## 2026-05-22 — Phase 0 — Bootstrap: git, GitHub, Supabase link

### Built
- Local `git` repository initialized on `main` with a Node/Next/Expo/Supabase `.gitignore`.
- Private GitHub repo `Wollie333/Vilo2027` (created in dashboard by user); `main` pushed.
- `.env.example` created from the `ENV_VARS.md` §9 template (keys only — no secrets).
- Supabase project `Vilo2027` provisioned (ref `zlcivjgvtyeaszikqleu`, region `Central EU (Frankfurt)`).
- `supabase init` + `supabase login` (CLI access token) + `supabase link --project-ref zlcivjgvtyeaszikqleu` completed and verified.
- `.env.local` populated with Supabase project URL + new-format API keys (`sb_publishable_…`, `sb_secret_…`); confirmed untracked.
- `CURRENT_TASK.md` populated as the session contract.
- `gh` CLI 2.92.0 installed via winget; `supabase` CLI 2.101.0 installed via direct binary release (no winget package exists).

### Changed
- Local-only git identity set for this repo: `user.email=wollie333@gmail.com`, `user.name=Wollie333`. No global config touched.
- `PHASE_PLAN.md` Phase 5 line "Supabase region confirmed: af-south-1" annotated with the current Frankfurt provisioning + migration requirement.

### Decisions
- **ADR-015** added: Supabase deployed to Central EU (Frankfurt) rather than `af-south-1` (Cape Town). `af-south-1` was unavailable in the Supabase dashboard for this account at provisioning time. The region MUST be migrated before public launch for POPIA compliance.

### Migrations
- None this session — DB schema work begins once `supabase_database.md` lands.

### Notes
- Supabase keys are the newer `sb_publishable_` / `sb_secret_` format (replacements for legacy `anon`/`service_role` JWTs). They work transparently with `@supabase/supabase-js` ≥2.43.x — no SDK bump required.
- Only **one** Supabase project exists. The plan originally called for production + staging; staging deferred to a future session.
- An earlier Vilo2027 project (ref `ddexrmfuqtvmumgvzqxz`, West EU / Ireland) was created and deleted by the user when neither it nor a re-attempt offered `af-south-1`. Both attempts confirmed `af-south-1` is not currently available for this Supabase account.
- `viloplatform.com` domain ownership and Resend / Doppler / Vercel / EAS / Sentry / PostHog / Mapbox / Paystack / PayPal accounts are NOT set up yet — placeholders remain in `.env.local`.
- `supabase_database.md`, `vilo-platform-mvp.md`, and `customer_journey.md` are still missing from the repo. The Phase 0 Database section is blocked until at least `supabase_database.md` is added.

## 2026-05-22 — Phase 0 — Specs added: product, schema, customer journey

### Built
- `vilo-platform-mvp.md` (85 KB) added — full v1.2 product spec with 10 core modules including Refund Manager (6.9) and Policy Manager (6.10).
- `supabase_database.md` (137 KB) added — complete DB architecture: 11 domains, RLS, functions, triggers, pg_cron, Realtime, Storage, seed data, migration strategy. Requires extensions `uuid-ossp`, `pgcrypto`, `pg_trgm`, `postgis`, `pg_cron`.
- `customer_journey.md` (86 KB) added — 6 personas across ~50 end-to-end journeys (guest, host free/pro/business, staff, admin, subscriptions).

### Changed
- `CURRENT_TASK.md` Session Notes: missing-specs blocker removed from "Blockers carried into the next session".
- Decided next session focus: scaffold monorepo + Next.js web app (`apps/web`) per `DEVSTACK.md` §1.1 + §6.

### Notes
- Phase 0 Database section is now **unblocked** — migrations 000000 → 000017 and the v1.1 migration set (20260502000000 → 20260502000017) can be applied in a future session.
- `RULES.md` §2 and `AGENT_RULES.md` §2 ("read `supabase_database.md` before any DB-related work") can now be satisfied.
- Active blockers remaining: Supabase region migration to `af-south-1` (see ADR-015), `viloplatform.com` domain ownership not confirmed.

## 2026-05-22 — Phase 0 — Monorepo scaffold + Next.js web app

### Built
- pnpm monorepo: root `package.json` (private), `pnpm-workspace.yaml` declaring `apps/*` + `packages/*`, `turbo.json` with build/dev/lint/type-check tasks, `tsconfig.base.json` for shared TS strict settings.
- `apps/web` — Next.js 14.2.35 App Router, TypeScript strict, Tailwind 3.4, no `src/` dir, `@/*` import alias. `tsconfig.json` extends the root base.
- Brand-token Tailwind config (`apps/web/tailwind.config.ts`): Vilo primary/secondary/accent/dark/light per `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §2 + status palette, custom border-radius (DEFAULT 10px, card 16px, pill, sm), Inter (sans) + Plus Jakarta Sans (display) via CSS variables, shadcn semantic tokens layered on top.
- `apps/web/app/globals.css` — shadcn-style HSL CSS variables tuned to Vilo brand (background = brand.light, foreground = brand.dark, primary = brand.primary).
- `next/font/google` wiring in `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` for Inter + Plus Jakarta Sans (zero layout shift, auto self-hosted).
- shadcn/ui configuration: `components.json` + `lib/utils.ts` (cn helper). Component installs (`pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add ...`) can proceed in any future session.
- Supabase SSR wiring per `ARCHITECTURE.md` §7:
  - `lib/supabase/client.ts` — `createBrowserClient` for Client Components.
  - `lib/supabase/server.ts` — `createServerClient` with Next.js cookie store for Server Components and Server Actions.
  - `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` — `updateSession` helper that refreshes the JWT cookie on each request.
  - `middleware.ts` — wires the helper into Next.js middleware with the standard matcher (skips `_next/static`, `_next/image`, favicon, common image asset paths).
- `apps/web/app/page.tsx` — Server Component homepage that fetches `/auth/v1/health` on the linked Supabase project; renders "OK — GoTrue v2.189.0" in green when reachable. Confirms the env vars load and the network path to Supabase works end-to-end.
- `packages/types` — workspace package with placeholder `database.types.ts`. Populated by `supabase gen types typescript` after DB migrations land.

### Changed
- Removed scaffold-default Geist fonts (`apps/web/app/fonts/`).
- Replaced the default Next.js boilerplate `page.tsx` and `globals.css` with brand-aligned versions.
- Copied root `.env.local` to `apps/web/.env.local` so Next.js can resolve `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars; both stay gitignored. Flagged in session notes — when `apps/mobile` lands, switch to a shared loader (dotenv-cli or `next.config.mjs` env merge) to avoid duplication.

### Notes
- **Verified end-to-end:** `pnpm --filter web build` and `pnpm --filter web lint` both pass with zero errors / zero warnings. Started dev server, curled `http://localhost:3000`, confirmed HTTP 200 and the rendered HTML contains the Supabase project URL plus a live "OK — GoTrue v2.189.0" connection signal from `/auth/v1/health`.
- **Node 22.17.1 in use.** `DEVSTACK.md` §1.4 locks Node 20 LTS; Next.js 14.2 is compatible with Node 22 so no blocker, but flagged for revisit.
- Minimal dep set installed — only what the homepage needs (`@supabase/supabase-js`, `@supabase/ssr`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `class-variance-authority`, `tailwindcss-animate`, `lucide-react`). The remaining `DEVSTACK.md` §6 deps (Mapbox, PayPal, Tiptap, react-big-calendar, Resend, react-email, Sentry, PostHog, sonner, react-dropzone, qrcode.react) will be added in the session that first uses each, per CLAUDE.md "least amount of code that solves the problem".
- Husky / lint-staged / Commitlint / Prettier are still pending — pick up in a polish session.

### Commits
- (Single commit for this slice — pushed to `main`.)

## 2026-05-22 — Phase 0 — DB schema live + CI workflows scaffolded

### Built
- **27 SQL migrations** applied to live Supabase (`zlcivjgvtyeaszikqleu`):
  - 18 v1.0 migrations (extensions, 9 domains, RLS helpers/policies, functions, triggers, cron, storage RLS, seed)
  - 9 v1.1 migrations (Policy Manager + Refund Manager domains, ALTERs, RLS, functions, triggers, cron, storage, seed)
- Full schema: 46 tables, 4 RLS helper functions, 8+ business functions (`check_feature_permission`, `calculate_booking_price`, `calculate_policy_refund_amount`, `snapshot_booking_policies`, `recalculate_listing_ranking`, etc.), 13+ triggers, 15 pg_cron jobs.
- Realtime publication enabled for `messages`, `conversations`, `bookings`.
- Storage RLS policies for 6 buckets (`listing-photos`, `host-avatars`, `host-covers`, `eft-proofs`, `message-attachments`, `refund-requests`) — buckets themselves still need to be created in the Supabase dashboard.
- `packages/types/database.types.ts` regenerated (3479 lines) — covers full schema.
- All 5 GitHub Actions workflows written per `CI_CD.md`:
  - `ci.yml` — PR validation (typecheck, lint, tests, E2E)
  - `db-migrate.yml` — auto-apply schema on push + auto-regen + auto-commit types
  - `deploy-functions.yml` — Edge Functions deploy
  - `deploy-web.yml` — Vercel deploy
  - `mobile-preview.yml` — EAS OTA on `develop`

### Fixed
- `gen_random_bytes()` calls qualified with `extensions.` schema in `staff_invites.token` and `reviews.review_token` defaults — Supabase puts pgcrypto in the `extensions` schema, not `public`, so unqualified calls fail.

### Notes
- **DB verified live:** queried `platform_settings` via PostgREST, all 10 seeded keys returned.
- Migrations follow the spec exactly except for one deviation: `blocked_dates` moved from the listings migration to the bookings migration to resolve a forward FK to `bookings(id)`.
- Single Supabase project (no staging yet) per ADR-015. The Frankfurt → af-south-1 migration is still required before public launch.
- **Vercel deploy failing:** the first push triggered a Vercel build that compiled cleanly but reported "No Output Directory named public found". Fix: in Vercel Project Settings → Build & Development Settings, set **Root Directory** to `apps/web`. Then redeploy. (Not done in this session — user-side action.)
- **Storage buckets still need to be created** by hand in the dashboard (Storage → New bucket). The RLS policies are already in place; they only activate once buckets exist.

### Active blockers / user-side actions for Phase 0
- Doppler account + dev/staging/prod configs
- Vercel root-dir fix + first successful deploy
- EAS account + `eas init` for `apps/mobile`
- Sentry projects (web + mobile)
- PostHog project
- Resend account + `viloplatform.com` domain verification (domain itself not yet registered)
- 6 Supabase Storage buckets

### Still TODO (autonomous in next session)
- Scaffold `apps/mobile` (Expo + NativeWind + Expo Router)
- Install shadcn/ui component set from `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
- Prettier + Husky + Commitlint config
- `emails/` directory + React Email setup
- Tighten Vercel monorepo config (`vercel.json` or root-dir setting)

### Commits
- `feat(db): add v1.0 schema migrations` — `7c1ec14`
- `feat(db): add v1.1 schema migrations (Refund + Policy Manager)` — `9fa4e67`
- `feat(db): apply 27 migrations + generate database.types.ts` — `c623cba`
