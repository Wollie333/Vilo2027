# Host-Side Feature Verification — Progress Tracker

> **Durable across days.** This is the file to read first when resuming. It
> records what's verified, what's next, how to re-seed, and the working method.
> Full plan: `C:\Users\Wollie\.claude\plans\i-want-to-start-cosmic-lerdorf.md`.

## Goal
Walk every host-side feature (`/dashboard/**`) in dependency order and confirm
each works **100%** before moving to the next, fixing broken code on the spot.

## How to resume (daily)
1. Read this file + the "Activity log" at the bottom.
2. Start the app: from `apps/web` run `pnpm dev` → http://localhost:3000
3. Log in as the demo host (below). Re-seed if data looks off.
4. Continue at the first ⬜ feature in the checklist.

## Demo data / login
- **Seed command:** from `apps/web` → `pnpm seed:demo` (idempotent, safe to re-run)
- **Script:** `apps/web/scripts/seed-demo.mjs` (Cloud, service-role key from `.env.local`)
- **Host login:** `host@vilodemo.com` / `ViloDemo123!`
- **Guest login:** `guest@vilodemo.com` / `ViloDemo123!`
- **Seeded:** 2 listings (Seaview Cottage = whole_listing; The Vines = flexible/rooms),
  2 rooms, 2 add-ons, seasonal pricing, 5 bookings (pending/confirmed/completed/
  cancelled/rooms), 4 payments, 1 pending refund request, 3 auto-invoices,
  1 conversation, 1 review.

## Working method (per feature)
1. **Audit** (can be a sub-agent, see below): read page + server actions + RLS;
   check RHF+Zod, server-action-only mutations, feature gate, no `any`, Realtime cleanup.
2. **Static gate:** `pnpm build` + `pnpm lint` + `pnpm type-check` (from `apps/web`).
3. **Live check:** founder runs the flow in the browser; reports breakage.
4. **Fix** → re-run static gate → founder re-checks.
5. Mark ✅ here + note any deviation, then move on.

## Parallelization with sub-agents
The **live + fix loop stays sequential** (it's founder-driven and dependency-ordered).
What we parallelize is the **read-only code-audit** ahead of each live session:
- Before each work session, fan out **3–4 audit sub-agents at once**, one per
  upcoming feature, each returning a findings list (bugs, missing gates, `any`
  usage, broken imports, RLS gaps). Audits are read-only so they can't collide.
- We then sit down and do the live+fix loop with the issues already mapped.
- **Don't** parallelize fixes to interdependent features (e.g. bookings ↔ payments)
  — apply those sequentially to avoid conflicting edits.
- Good independent-audit batches: {Help, Notifications, Staff}, {Quotes, Invoices,
  Add-ons}, {Subscription, Banking, Host profile}, {Seasonal pricing, Calendar, iCal}.

## Checklist (foundation → leaf)
Status: ⬜ not started · 🟦 in progress · ✅ done · ⚠️ done w/ caveat

- [✅] **0. Demo seed script** — idempotent, verified (triggers fire, no counter inflation).
- [🟦] 1. Onboarding setup wizard — `/dashboard/setup`. Full rework code-complete on branch
  `feat/setup-wizard-rework` (all build/lint/type-check green); **awaiting founder live check**.
  FLOW: `/signup/host` → host+draft listing → `/dashboard` checklist → `/dashboard/setup`
  5 steps **Profile → Banking → Listing → Policies → Review** → publish → `/dashboard`.
  Rework done: 1a shared completion (fixes "incomplete after publish"); 1b full RoomEditorSheet
  (details+photos+amenities, create-first); 1c shell redesign (dark hero, progress ring, step
  chips, active glow, globals CSS); 1d About WYSIWYG + banking reveal; 1e guest-preview review
  with per-section Edit buttons + confetti on publish. Earlier: avatar-hang fix (StepProfile).
- [⚠️] 2. Host profile — lives at `/dashboard/settings` (`/dashboard/settings/host` is a redirect).
  Code audited: RHF+Zod, server-action-only mutations, RLS-scoped host update, no `any` ✅.
  Fixed: (a) leftover `viloplatform.com` handle hint → relative public path (`1bfe568`);
  (b) avatar size limit mismatch 8MB client vs 5MB server → aligned to 4MB both sides, under
  the Vercel Server-Action body cap (`8194853`). **Founder live-check pending.**
- [⚠️] 3. Banking details — `/dashboard/settings/banking`. Code audited CLEAN, no changes:
  all 12 actions auth-gated via `resolveHost()`; account numbers + gateway secrets encrypted
  at rest and decrypted server-side ONLY for outbound Paystack calls (never returned to client);
  no `any`, no stray logs; RHF+Zod (schemas.ts); logo upload resizes client-side to ≤512px
  before posting (no body-cap risk). **Founder live-check pending.**
- [⚠️] 4. Subscription & billing — `/dashboard/settings/subscription`. Code audited CLEAN:
  switch/cancel/reactivate actions all auth-gated (`getMyHostId`), Zod-validated, RLS-scoped,
  no `any`/logs; PlanPicker `plan ===` checks are switcher UX, not feature gates. **Known gap
  (launch-blocker, NOT a bug):** real Paystack/PayPal subscription billing is intentionally
  stubbed pre-MVP — `switchPlanAction` records state only; wire provider + webhooks before
  launch (founder ops/keys). **Founder live-check pending.**
- [⚠️] 5. Listings (portfolio/new/edit/photos/amenities) — `/dashboard/listings`. Audited:
  all 20 edit actions auth-gated (`assertOwnership`), no `any`/logs; photos use the direct
  browser→Storage pair (`createListingPhotoUploadUrl` + `registerListingPhotoAction`, no body
  cap); publish gate enforces required fields + `hostHasValidEft` + full `computeSetupCompletion`
  at the app layer AND the `trg_listing_requires_bank` DB trigger. Fixed: removed the dead
  `uploadListingPhotoAction` (8MB-through-action body-cap footgun, zero callers) (`cfd0e64`).
  **Founder live-check pending** (editor tabs, photo upload UX, publish flow).
- [⚠️] 6. Rooms — `/dashboard/rooms` (cross-listing overview; the room editor lives under
  #5). Audited CLEAN: no `any`/logs; the only mutation (`setBookingModeAction`) is the
  auth-gated listings action; page reads are explicitly `host_id`-scoped (the dashboard
  query gotcha — public-readable tables filtered to the owner). **Founder live-check pending.**
- [⬜] 7. Seasonal pricing — `/dashboard/seasonal-pricing`
- [⬜] 8. Add-ons — `/dashboard/addons`
- [⬜] 9. Availability calendar — `/dashboard/calendar`
- [⬜] 10. iCal calendar-sync — `/dashboard/calendar-sync`
- [⬜] 11. Bookings board + detail — `/dashboard/bookings`
- [⬜] 12. Manual booking — `/dashboard/bookings/new`
- [⬜] 13. Quotes — `/dashboard/quotes`
- [⬜] 14. Payments — `/dashboard/payments`
- [⬜] 15. Refunds — `/dashboard/refunds`
- [⬜] 16. Invoices — `/dashboard/invoices`
- [⬜] 17. Inbox + templates — `/dashboard/inbox`
- [⬜] 18. Notifications — `/dashboard/notifications`
- [⬜] 19. Reviews — `/dashboard/reviews`
- [⬜] 20. Staff — `/dashboard/staff`
- [⬜] 21. Help center — `/dashboard/help/*`
- [⬜] 22. Settings hub + Data/Privacy + Notification prefs — `/dashboard/settings`
- [⬜] 23. Dashboard home KPIs — `/dashboard` (last — aggregates everything)

> Stubs (confirm placeholder only, not built out): `/dashboard/reports`, `/dashboard/channels`.

## Known caveats to revisit
- Seeded published review does NOT bump `hosts.avg_rating` / `total_reviews`
  (rating trigger likely keys on a publish transition). Re-check at #19 / #23.
- 1 extra listing/rooms/addon rows exist from earlier testing under a different
  host — the demo host only sees its own 2 listings (RLS-scoped). Harmless.

---
## Static-gate baseline (2026-05-28)
- `pnpm type-check` → clean ✅
- `pnpm lint` → 1 pre-existing warning only: `app/dashboard/help/_components/PopularArticles.tsx:137`
  (`aria-pressed` on role=tab). Fix when we reach #21 Help.
- `pnpm build` → not yet run.

## Activity log (latest first)
- **2026-06-04** — Feature #1 wrap-up: the `feat/setup-wizard-rework` branch was already
  fully merged into `main` (0 commits ahead), so the stale remote branch was deleted — no
  merge needed, nothing reverted. Audited feature #2 (Host profile, at `/dashboard/settings`):
  code is sound; fixed two concrete issues in small commits — the `viloplatform.com` handle
  hint (`1bfe568`) and the 8MB-client/5MB-server avatar limit mismatch → 4MB both sides under
  the Vercel body cap (`8194853`). Then audited #3 Banking — clean, no changes needed (secrets
  encrypted + server-only, all 12 actions auth-gated, logo resizes client-side before upload).
  **NEXT: founder live-checks Host profile + Banking, then #4 Subscription.**
- **2026-06-04 (cont.)** — Audited #4 Subscription & billing — code clean (switch/cancel/
  reactivate actions auth-gated + Zod + RLS, no `any`/logs; PlanPicker checks are switcher UX).
  Only gap is real provider billing, stubbed pre-MVP — a launch-blocker, not a bug. No code
  changes. **NEXT: founder live-checks #2/#3/#4, then #5 Listings.**
- **2026-06-04 (cont.)** — Audited #5 Listings — high-risk surfaces clean: 20 edit actions
  auth-gated, photos use direct browser→Storage uploads, publish gate enforces EFT + completion
  (app + DB trigger). Removed the dead `uploadListingPhotoAction` body-cap footgun (`cfd0e64`).
  **NEXT: founder live-checks #2–#5, then #6 Rooms.**
- **2026-06-04 (cont.)** — Audited #6 Rooms (`/dashboard/rooms`) — clean, no changes: mutation
  via the auth-gated `setBookingModeAction`, page reads explicitly `host_id`-scoped. **NEXT:
  founder live-checks #2–#6, then #7 Seasonal pricing.**
- **2026-05-29 (setup redesign):** Decoded the real `Setup Flow (standalone).html`
  mockup (web-archive: gzip+base64 JSX resources extracted via Node) and rebuilt
  `/dashboard/setup` to match: single-scroll page, sticky left ProgressRail (% bar +
  section list + Publish), page intro + circular % ring, stacked SectionCards with
  scroll-spy glow, and a **live browser-frame preview** (desktop/mobile) of the public
  listing. Publish → confetti (Groot Baas Wollie likes it — keep) + "You're live" modal.
  New `SetupPreview.tsx`; `SetupWizard.tsx` rebuilt; removed `StepReview.tsx`. Tokens:
  peek shadow (tailwind), focus-ring + pick-card (globals). On `origin/main` (6a50d82),
  deploying. Step-card INTERNALS still use existing styling (offer pick-cards / capacity
  steppers / amenity chips not yet pixel-matched to mockup) — possible follow-up polish.

- **2026-05-28** — Built + verified the idempotent demo seed (Step 0: triggers fire,
  no counter inflation). Established static-gate baseline (type-check clean, 1 lint
  warning in Help). Audited feature #1 (Onboarding) — no blockers, flow completes;
  corrected flow understanding (5 steps, no payment step); 2 minor bugs logged.
  **NEXT: founder live-checks Onboarding in browser** (fresh signup → walk wizard).
  App code unchanged so far except `seed:demo` script + `scripts/seed-demo.mjs`.
- **2026-05-29** — Fixed avatar-upload hang in `StepProfile.tsx` (try/finally + 8 MB /
  image-type guard + input reset). Branch-code finding was a false positive; no change.
- **2026-05-29 (later)** — Onboarding rework COMPLETE in code (1a–1e). 1a/1d/1b pushed to
  `origin/main`. A concurrent `feat/policy-manager` track collided in the shared worktree;
  per founder, published it to main (a3fb60d). Resumed 1c/1e on branch
  `feat/setup-wizard-rework` (off integrated tip, pushed). 1c = wizard shell redesign +
  `globals.css` setup utilities; 1e = StepReview guest-preview + per-section Edit + confetti.
  All green (clean-cache build). **NEXT: founder live-checks the whole wizard, then merge
  `feat/setup-wizard-rework` → main and mark #1 ✅.**
- **2026-05-29 (wizard rework, approved plan):** Building feature #1 rework in increments.
  DONE so far (all build+lint+type-check clean):
  • **1a Shared completion** — new `lib/setup/completion.ts`; rewired both
    `SetupWizard.computeInitialDone` AND `lib/help/queries.ts fetchGettingStartedState`.
    Fixes the "incomplete after publish" bug (policies now needs cancellation_policy +
    check-in + check-out; photos & rooms now counted; experiences skip check-in/out).
  • **1d WYSIWYG About** — added rich-text About field to StepListing (reuses
    `RichTextEditor`); folded its save into the renamed "Save details" button (one fewer
    button). `saveListingPatchAction` now sanitises description on input (sanitiseListingHtml).
    Added `description` to Listing type + setup page fetch.
  • **1d Banking reveal** — setup page now passes full decrypted account number + swift_code;
    StepBanking card shows holder/bank/number(masked+eye-reveal)/branch/SWIFT in full.
    BankAccount type swapped account_last4 → account_number + swift_code. ADR-009 added.
  REMAINING for #1: 1b (full RoomEditor in a sheet — create-first flow), 1c (wizard shell
  redesign: dark hero, progress ring/stepper, dotgrid, confetti, one-save-per-step, globals CSS),
  1e (visitor-style review preview with per-section Edit; remove plan card).
  **NEXT:** founder can live-check 1a/1d now (About field saves+renders; banking card shows
  full details w/ reveal; dashboard checklist completes after publish). Then I continue 1b/1c/1e.
