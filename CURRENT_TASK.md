# Vilo — Current Task

> Reset at the start of every session. This is the session contract.

## ▶▶ SAVE POINT — RESUME HERE (· 2026-06-27 PM #2 — FORMS EPICS 3 + 4 ALL DONE; NEXT = menu-builder polish OR new theme)

**Branch:** `main` — working tree CLEAN, all work committed + **PUSHED** (latest `9eca33f`, origin == local). tsc + lint + **131 vitest** GREEN. **Verify with `cd apps/web && pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` + `pnpm next lint` + the Preview MCP — NEVER `pnpm build` while a dev server runs** (shared `.next`).

**✅ DONE THIS (PM #2) SESSION — the whole FORMS backlog (EPIC 3 + EPIC 4), 5 commits, each verified live + pushed (per-commit detail in CHANGELOG 2026-06-27 PM):**
- **EPIC 3a (`5be2e0b`)** — a `rooms` form field auto-populates the host's REAL visible rooms (like nav auto-rooms). `loadSiteForms` injects `orderedVisibleRooms` names into every `rooms` field (snapshot-aware SSOT); new `loadWebsiteRoomNames` feeds the Form editor, which now shows live rooms read-only instead of "Room A/Room B".
- **EPIC 3b (`269fbcd`)** — consent field links to T&Cs + opts into marketing. 3 additive consent props (`linkUrl`/`linkLabel`/`marketing`); scheme-guarded link (target=_blank + forced rel) in the label; a ticked `marketing` consent writes write-once `email_consent` + a `website-optin` tag on the contact. Editor gained Link URL / Link text / Subscribe-to-marketing controls.
- **EPIC 3c (`ee20212`)** — every field type adopts the active theme. `SAFARI_FORM_VARS` now maps `--site-accent`→`var(--accent)`; `FormSection` applies `accent-color` to the shared field style + every checkbox/radio/consent input. Verified: consent link + tick + input accent all = the Safari ochre.
- **EPIC 4a (`7e7e169`)** — website enquiry renders as a quote-request-style card. New `components/inbox/WebsiteEnquiryCard.tsx` (sky border, globe, "Website enquiry" pill, contact rows); `ChatMessageWall` dispatches the `website_enquiry` event to it. Inbox chip "Website" → "Website enquiry".
- **EPIC 4b (`9eca33f`) — FOUNDER CHOSE auto-create draft quote.** A booking form (a `dates` field w/ both dates) routes to the REAL quote pipeline: `submitWebsiteForm` resolves the property from the chosen room (`resolveBookingTarget`: room name → room+property scope=rooms; else single-property whole_listing) → `createEnquiry(..., {source:"website"})` → auto-priced DRAFT quote + a real `ThreadQuoteCard` "Quote request (draft)" + "Complete & send quote" CTA, keeping the "Website enquiry" pill. Unresolvable/declined → falls back to the plain enquiry. `createEnquiry` gained an optional server-only `source` arg. Verified live: Olive Room/2 guests/1–5 Aug → website-source conv bound to Olive Grove + draft quote R5 350.

**GOTCHA REINFORCED:** cleaning test rows via the service-role node script — do NOT use broad jsonb filters like `.contains("data", {})` (matches EVERY row); delete by specific id. The seed creates NO `website_form_submissions`, so any present are test rows.

**▶▶ NEXT (founder's call — forms backlog fully cleared):**
- **Optional menu-builder polish** (carried): drag-to-NEST (currently nest via the indent button; drag only reorders within a level); a mobile-drawer live preview in the menu builder.
- **Start the SECOND theme** — Safari reference + `THEME_CONTRACT.md` + the now-shared forms/inbox machinery = "scope the design, reuse the engine". Replay [[theme-productionization-playbook]].
- **Forms follow-ons (if wanted):** a single `date` field could also drive booking intent (only the `dates` range does now); richer `guests_breakdown` (children/infants/pets) from guest fields; show the website-source quote's pill on the thread HEADER too (list chip already shows it).

**GOTCHAS (all bit this session):**
- **CLASS-CONCAT SPACE BUG** — `` `${a}${cond?"x":""}` `` drops the space → one bad class (`"devicex"`). It silently broke the header-scroll preview AND has bitten the menu class before. ALWAYS use `[a, cond?"x":""].filter(Boolean).join(" ")`.
- **PowerShell `Get/Set-Content` CORRUPTS UTF-8** (box-drawing/em-dash → `â”€`). Use Git-Bash `sed -i 'A,Bd'` or the Edit tool — never round-trip a source file through PS.
- **PREVIEW-MCP serverId rotates each session + can be lost mid-session** → free :3000 (`Stop-Process -Id <pid>`) + `preview_start web` to re-acquire (browser login persists). When verifying live, **append a cache-bust `&_cb=<n>` to the URL** — same-URL navigations hit bfcache and read STALE.
- commitlint needs a **lowercase** subject after `type(scope):`.

**★★ THE STANDARD IS NOW WRITTEN: `THEME_CONTRACT.md` (repo root) — READ IT FIRST for any nav/header/menu/section/builder work.** 3 layers (1 shared schema/types · 2 shared builder UI · 3 per-theme render). **NORTH STAR (founder, "most important aspect of the CMS"): upload a theme's raw HTML/CSS/JS and CONFORM it to the contract** → the conformance workflow + the full header/menu **settings-contract table** are in that doc. Rule: ask "which LAYER?"; layer-1/2 work benefits every theme for free; only layer-3 (render + scoped CSS) is per-theme. Memory: [[theme-productionization-playbook]] (now carries the north star + the header/menu standard).

**✅ DONE THIS SESSION (all verified live + committed + pushed; per-commit detail in CHANGELOG 2026-06-27):**
- **Safari FORMS loop** (`cb0b975`) — `SafariContactForm` submits → themed enquiry thank-you; `form` block dispatched on Safari; new `lib/site/thankYouHref.ts` (path-aware). **Per-page marketing** (pixel-event + head-code in Page settings → `PageHeadCode`/`FirePixelEvent`). **Phantom "Unpublished changes"** fix (`bc47720`).
- **HEADER BUILDER — every setting now works on Safari + is WYSIWYG:** layouts classic/centered/split/minimal (`03258f9`); behaviour `sticky` + `transparentOverHero`(schema now OPTIONAL = "theme decides") + `bgColor`/`scrolledBgColor` (`59b7b50`); `logoStyle` + `menuCollapse` (`8483234`); correctness fixes — showLogo-off=wordmark, luminance auto-contrast on dark bars, book colour persists on hover (`fc5fffe`); logo height scales the monogram (`e851ec1`); **header builder canvas previews the sticky-scroll interaction + honours the toggle** (`4fd9a12` + the space-bug fix `124042f`).
- **MENU BUILDER (`MenuStudio`) — full overhaul:** sub-menu (dropdown) styling + Layout tab + moved `menuCollapse` out of the header (`2198c19`); **drag-and-drop reordering** (reuses `SortableList`/@dnd-kit, deterministic DndContext `id` to kill the nested-SSR hydration warning) (`e8e8610`); **per-device styling desktop/tablet/mobile** (page-builder responsive pattern, scoped: tablet = inline-menu override via `@media`, mobile = the `.mnav` drawer/overlay with its own bg; the top-bar device switcher drives which layer the Style tab edits) (`6a81dd5`).

**▶▶ ~~NEXT — FORMS epics~~ ✅ ALL DONE in PM #2 (see the top save point). Original brief kept for reference:**
- **EPIC 3 — Forms: data & theme.** Booking form **room-select pre-fills the host's REAL rooms** (`field.type==="rooms"` already exists in `forms.schema.ts` — make it auto-populate from live rooms, like the nav auto-rooms). **Consent field** → link to T&Cs + opt the guest into the host's marketing (set marketing-subscribe on the guest record). Forms **auto-adopt the active theme's style** (Safari) — the `form` block already bridges `--site-*`→Safari; extend to all field types.
- **EPIC 4 — Forms → Inbox.** Booking/enquiry creates an inbox **quote request** (not just an enquiry); every submission opens a host↔guest message **thread**; the website enquiry must be **formatted like "Request a quote"** with a **"Website enquiry" pill**. (`lib/website/createWebsiteEnquiry.ts` already opens a website-source conversation + system message — align its formatting with the quote-request inbox; wire booking enquiries to the quote pipeline. Study the existing quote-request inbox rendering first.)
- **Optional menu-builder polish (founder may want more):** drag-to-NEST (currently nest via the indent button; drag only reorders within a level); a mobile-drawer live preview in the menu builder (the device switcher resizes the frame but the drawer is open-on-click).

## ▶▶ PRIOR SAVE POINT (· 2026-06-26 — Safari was the reference; the 2 tasks above were the remaining work)

**Branch:** `main` — working tree CLEAN, all work committed + PUSHED (latest `575f8f2`). tsc + lint + **131 vitest** GREEN. **Verify with `cd apps/web && pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` + `pnpm next lint` + the Preview MCP — NEVER `pnpm build` while a dev server runs** (shared `.next`; corrupts on big-refactor HMR → stop server, `rm -rf apps/web/.next`, free :3000, restart).

**🔑 TEST FIXTURE:** `cd apps/web && pnpm seed:test-site` → host `host@vilotest.com` / `ViloTest123!`. Olive Grove Guesthouse (subdomain `vilotest`, theme = safari, PUBLISHED) + 3 rooms (Olive R1300 / Vineyard R1900 / Mountain Loft R2100). websiteId `0b999999-9999-4999-8999-999999999991`; home pageId `ffe05ac1-4cf4-402d-ab88-10b7e58aeacf`. **Preview a Safari page:** `/en/site/<slug>?site=vilotest&preview=1&theme=safari` (home = `/en/site?site=vilotest...`). **🟢 NEW: the Preview-MCP browser IS LOGGED IN as the test host — the BUILDER UI IS REACHABLE** at `/en/website-editor/<websiteId>/pages/<pageId>` + the nav managers at `/en/website-editor/<websiteId>/navigation/{header,menu,footer}`. Reseed page `draft_sections` / tweak settings directly via `node --env-file=.env.local` + `@supabase/supabase-js` service role. (Published sites read the frozen `published_snapshot` — set a value in BOTH `settings` + `published_snapshot` to test on the live, non-preview render; e.g. the pixel.)

**✅ THE WHOLE SAFARI THEME IS NOW A FULLY FUNCTIONAL, EDITABLE, CONVERSION-TRACKED WEBSITE — the reference implementation to replay for every new theme.** This session shipped (all verified live, each its own commit):
- **All pages pixel-perfect + section-driven** (home/about/suites/contact/journal index+article/checkout/thank-you) — builder canvas === live; bind real data (rooms/posts/contact/booking).
- **Chrome data-driven + editable INLINE in the page builder** — header (real logo light/dark, tagline), footer (columns/copyright/powered-by/socials/newsletter), announcement top-bar; all from `navigation` + `brand`, click-to-select in the page-builder canvas (`SafariShell` `editable` prop + `ChromeEditWrap`).
- **Nav managers render the REAL design + LIVE two-way binding** (`NavSectionEditor` + `MenuStudio` render the real `SafariShell` + a stock hero; edits show instantly; off-theme keeps the generic preview).
- **Forms → conversion-goal thank-you** — per-form `goal` + `afterSubmit:page` default; `/thank-you/[[...goal]]` (enquiry/quote/subscribe/general), type-aware copy.
- **Meta Pixel** — `SiteMarketing` now loads on Safari (was SiteChrome-only); `FirePurchase` fires dynamic Purchase (value/currency/ref) on the on-site booking thank-you; `FirePixelEvent` fires Lead/Subscribe on the goal thank-yous. Pixel-ID field already in Settings.
- **Fixed: menu colour/hover now applies in EVERY nav state** (was solid-bar/drawer only → looked dead over the hero).

**📋 THE PROCESS IS NOW A MEMORY: `theme-productionization-playbook` — every new theme FUNCTIONS identically (shared machinery); only the STYLING + which elements exist are scoped to that design. Replay the 6 slices: render-layer · pages · chrome · forms+thank-you · pixel · per-page-settings.**

**▶▶ NEXT — 2 tasks left to finish the Safari reference (then it's "scope the design, reuse the engine" for new themes):**
1. **Forms render ON Safari pages.** `renderSafariSection` doesn't dispatch the `form` block yet, and the Safari `contact_form` band (`SafariContactForm`) is a static placeholder (button `type=button`, no submit). So a host can't trigger the form→thank-you loop FROM a Safari page. Fix: dispatch `form` on Safari (Safari-styled `FormSection`) and/or wire `SafariContactForm` to POST `/api/website-enquiry` + redirect to `/thank-you/<goal>`.
2. **Per-page Page-settings controls** (founder asks): a per-page **Pixel-event toggle** ("navigate to each page, choose whether/which event fires there") + a **custom head-code box** ("meta code in page settings"). Add to the page-settings panel (`PageSeoCard` area) + a per-page store (e.g. `seo_overrides` or a new field) + inject the head code on the live page. See [[safari-forms-pixel-todo]].

## ▶▶ EARLIER SAVE POINT (· Safari HOME gold standard)

**Branch:** `main` — working tree CLEAN, all work committed + PUSHED (origin/main == local, latest `67fe239`). tsc + lint + **131 vitest** GREEN. **Verify with `cd apps/web && pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` + `pnpm next lint` + the Preview MCP — NEVER `pnpm build` while a dev server runs** (shared `.next`). Preview-managed dev server on :3000 (name `web`, serverId rotates). **`.next` corrupts on HMR after big refactors (`vendor-chunks`/`useContext`-null 500 OR a stale `ReferenceError` even when tsc/vitest are GREEN) — recover: stop the preview server, `rm -rf apps/web/.next`, free :3000 (`Stop-Process`), restart. Hit it 3× across recent sessions.**

**🔑 TEST FIXTURE:** `cd apps/web && pnpm seed:test-site` → host `host@vilotest.com` / `ViloTest123!`. Olive Grove Guesthouse + 3 rooms (Olive Room R1300 / Vineyard R1900 / Mountain Loft R2100) + a Safari site (subdomain `vilotest`). **Preview a Safari page:** `/en/site/<slug>?site=vilotest&preview=1&theme=safari` (home = `/en/site?site=vilotest&preview=1&theme=safari`). websiteId `0b999999-9999-4999-8999-999999999991`; home pageId `ffe05ac1-4cf4-402d-ab88-10b7e58aeacf`. Builder: `/en/website-editor/<websiteId>/pages/<pageId>` (NEEDS the host login — preview MCP can't reach the builder UI; verify builder features via the public render, which reflects builder output). **The home draft carries the founder's gibberish test edits (their content — leave it); structure/functionality is sound.**

**✅ ALSO DONE (latest, `67fe239`): per-page SEO FEATURED IMAGE.** Page settings → SEO card now has an ImageField (upload/pick) for the page's share image → stored as a path in `website_pages.seo_overrides.image`; the public `og:image`+`twitter:image` prefer it over the site default. (Founder reported there was no way to set it.)

**✅ THE SAFARI HOME PAGE NOW WORKS END-TO-END — it is the reference pattern to replicate to the other Safari pages + (later) other themes.** Verified live this session (desktop 1280 + mobile 375): all 8 sections render, real data binds (3 suites / 7 gallery / 3 reviews), lightbox opens, grids collapse to 1 column on mobile, **zero horizontal overflow**, burger nav. The SAME machinery (one `SafariSectionList` + `renderSafariSection` + the device-tab inspector + the responsive CSS) is what every Safari page uses, so about/rooms/contact/room-detail/rates ALL inherit it automatically (confirmed: all 200 with the `vilo-rwrap`/`vilo-rdup` wrappers present).

**✅ FULL PER-DEVICE EDITING (audit pt.5–7, founder "everything changeable on desktop available in laptop+mobile, all sections, all pages"):** The Safari inspector tabs are **Desktop · Laptop · Mobile** (replacing Content/Advanced — Style tab dropped, inert on Safari). The Laptop/Mobile panes render the SAME `SectionFields` form as Desktop, editing a per-device override; only fields that DIFFER from desktop are stored (`responsive.{laptop,mobile}.props` — a loose partial-props record on `sectionBase`, additive no-migration), so untouched fields inherit. Plus a "hide on this screen" toggle. **Render** (`SafariSectionList`): a section with an override is rendered once per screen size (merged props; laptop⊃desktop, mobile⊃laptop) wrapped in `.vilo-rdup-{desktop,laptop,mobile}` (display:contents) shown for its range via BOTH `@media` (live) AND `@container` (builder device frames) — Desktop >1024, Laptop 641–1024, Mobile ≤640. Hide-only sections use the lighter single-render `.vilo-rwrap`. `SafariLightbox` skips images in hidden duplicates (offsetParent filter). Image fields show recommended dimensions (Safari-gated). Hero `cta_stack` is a real prop. **VERIFIED live** at 375px: hero mobile text+image+centre+stack + intro mobile heading render; at laptop only the desktop copy shows (1 of 3 in DOM).

**⚠️ DUPLICATE-RENDER edge cases (acceptable for now, noted):** a section WITH a per-device override renders 2–3× → duplicate element ids (e.g. `#suites`), 3× forms (contact_form is non-functional anyway), 3× lightbox imgs (mitigated by the offsetParent filter). Harden per-section if one ever bites.

**EARLIER AUDIT (pt.1–4), all DONE + pushed:**
- **pt.1 (`ab782a7`/`e7659e4`)** — hero: two CTAs (primary+secondary, label/href/show toggles), editable+hideable STAT ROW (`stats` array), alignment left/center/right (band now honours it; home default fixed to left), intro "2009" badge editable+hideable. Inspector controls are theme-scoped (`SectionEditor` takes `themePreset` from PageBuilder; Safari extras gated on `isSafari`). Builder block-selection chrome re-tinted to the theme accent on `.vilo-safari` (was emerald — the "green hue").
- **pt.2 (`89b1f6b`)** — exposed every remaining hardcoded section header: `rooms_preview` (band ignored its props — now uses eyebrow/heading/ctaLabel), `gallery`, `reviews` (eyebrow+subheading), `blog_preview`, `rate_table` all got `eyebrow`; inspector fields added per type (Safari-gated). All additive optional props w/ stock fallback (look unchanged until edited).
- **pt.3 (`3aa9f41`) — FULL MENU CONTROL.** The Safari nav was a separate simplified path that ignored MenuStudio (flat page-derived links, no dropdowns/style/book control). New `buildSafariNav(ctx)` (`lib/site/safariNav.ts`) resolves the header from `ctx.navigation` (prefers the host menu, auto-rooms-expanded, one level of dropdowns, **preview-aware hrefs** so nav links finally work in preview). `SafariNav` rewritten: desktop hover dropdowns + mobile accordion, host menu style (weight/uppercase everywhere; link colour scoped to solid bar+drawer so it can't vanish over the hero), host book button (label/visibility/colour from `header.*`). Threaded through SafariShell + all 5 mount points (SitePageView, SiteRoomView, book, blog index+article). VERIFIED live: Rooms▾ dropdown shows real rooms.

**▶▶ NEXT (the home is the reference — now standardise outward):** (1) **Replicate the home's working pattern to the other Safari page templates** (about/rooms/contact/room-detail/rates) — they already render via the same machinery, so this is a QA + polish pass per page (verify each at desktop+mobile, fix any per-page CSS gaps), NOT a rebuild. (2) Bring the **Desktop/Laptop/Mobile device-tab + per-device-override system to the GENERIC (non-Safari) themes** (currently gated on `isSafari`; the generic `SectionRenderer`/`SectionWrap` path needs the same `.vilo-rdup` duplicate-render + the inspector ungated). (3) Still hardcoded on Safari: the **FOOTER** (`SafariShell` — blurb/columns/newsletter/socials; `navigation.footer` already has the data) and the nav **LOGO** (monogram only — ignores the host logo image/`header.showLogo`/`logoStyle`).

**Verify with `cd apps/web && pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` + `pnpm next lint` + the Preview MCP — NEVER `pnpm build` while a dev server runs** (shared `.next`). Preview-managed dev server on :3000 (name `web`). **`.next` corrupts on repeated HMR (the `vendor-chunks`/`useContext`-null 500 gotcha) — recover: stop the preview server, `rm -rf apps/web/.next`, free :3000 (`Stop-Process`), restart preview. Hit it twice this session; the home page 500'd until cleared.**

---

### ▶▶ PRIOR SAVE POINT (· 2026-06-26, ALL 6 Safari pages now section-driven)

**Branch:** `main` — tsc + lint + **131 vitest** GREEN. **Verify with `cd apps/web && pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` + `pnpm next lint` + the Preview MCP — NEVER `pnpm build` while a dev server runs** (shared `.next`). Preview-managed dev server on :3000 (name `web`). **`.next` corrupts on repeated HMR (the `vendor-chunks`/`useContext`-null 500 gotcha) — recover: stop the preview server, `rm -rf apps/web/.next`, free :3000 (`Stop-Process`), restart preview. Hit it twice this session; the home page 500'd until cleared.**

**✅ THIS SESSION — the Safari "make every page editable" epic is essentially DONE.** All 6 content pages now render PUBLICLY from their sections via `SafariSectionList` (live === builder), not hardcoded `Safari*Content`: **home** (was already done) + **about, rooms, contact, room-detail, rates** (this session) + **blog** (its own real-posts route, unchanged). Commits: `384fda7` (schema fix + About), `fb7ebe4` (Contact + Rooms), `78680ae` (room-detail), `ab782a7` (rate_table + SafariSiteView collapse). Each verified live in the Preview MCP.

**🔴 KEY FIX (`384fda7`) — non-UUID section ids were silently DROPPED (real bug, not just the fixture).** `parseSectionsLoose` validated `sectionBase.id` with `z.string().uuid()`; the theme blueprints in `site_themes.page_templates` (seeded from migrations) use readable ids like `safari-about-hero`, so `getThemeBundle`→`applyThemeAction` produced sections that ALL got discarded on render → **blank public pages for any catalogue-applied theme**. Relaxed `sectionBase.id` to `z.string().min(1)` (ids are per-page React keys, not DB FKs). This one fix unblocked every page. (Note: the builder's own `newSection()`/`getThemeTemplates()` path always made UUIDs, so the home page already worked — only catalogue/seed blueprints carried the readable ids.)

**NEW Safari bands** in `renderSafariSection` (`components/site/sections/SafariSections.tsx`): `host_bio`, `contact_form` (enquiry grid showing the REAL host email/phone via `SafariCtx.contactEmail/contactPhone` ← SitePageView/SiteRoomView ← `ctx.brand`), `faq`, `amenities`, `pricing`, `blog_preview` (real posts + stock fallback), the 4 room-detail bands `room_gallery`(suite-hero + SafariLightbox)/`room_overview`/`room_amenities`/`room_rate` (bind the live `RoomDetail`; builder-canvas placeholder when no room), and `rate_table` (live rooms + Book CTA). Added optional `eyebrow` to the `contact_form`/`faq`/`amenities`/`pricing` schemas (renders a sensible default; inspector wiring is part of the audit below).

**`SafariSiteView` switch collapsed:** home/about/rooms/contact/rates + any custom page → one `SafariSectionList` (no-section pages fall back to `SafariGenericContent`); only checkout/thank-you/blog stay bespoke. `SiteRoomView`'s safari branch (`SiteRoomView.tsx`) now uses `SafariSectionList` too. `themeSections.test.ts` repaired (30 stale failures on removed legacy themes — PRE-EXISTING on HEAD; scoped to active themes aria/safari + content-based page checks; suite 181→131).

**▶▶ NEXT (start here) — the per-page STYLING / EDITABILITY AUDIT (founder wanted this AFTER all pages were in — they now are):**
1. **Hide controls that don't apply per theme+page.** E.g. the hero `overlay`/`overlayColor`/`overlayOpacity` inspector controls are INERT on Safari (its hero uses the CSS `--hero-overlay` gradient, not the generic overlay). Audit each section's inspector vs. what the Safari band actually honours; hide/disable the no-ops, FIX ones that should work.
2. **Wire the new `eyebrow` inspector fields** (contact_form/faq/amenities/pricing) into `SectionEditor` so they're host-editable (currently render a default only) — mirror the home bands' eyebrow wiring (see PHASE 2 "Editability").
3. **Still HARDCODED on the Safari bands** (theme character baked as defaults, candidates to expose as props): hero stat row (12,000/Big Five/4.98), intro "2009" badge, suites/gallery section headings.
4. Optional: `room_rates`/`seasonal_pricing` Safari bands (only `rate_table` is mapped — the other two fall back to generic); FUNCTIONAL submit wiring for the Safari `contact_form` (currently visual only, matching the prior hardcoded form's behaviour).

**Note:** the dead hardcoded page components (`SafariAboutContent`/`SafariRoomsContent`/`SafariContactContent`/`SafariRatesContent`/`SafariRoomContent`) are now UNUSED (imports removed) — kept on disk as design reference for the audit; safe to delete once the audit confirms parity.

**🔑 TEST FIXTURE:** `cd apps/web && pnpm seed:test-site` → host `host@vilotest.com` / `ViloTest123!`. Gives "Olive Grove Guesthouse" + 3 rooms (Olive Room R1300 / Vineyard Suite R1900 / Mountain Loft R2100) + a published Safari-theme site (subdomain `vilotest`) + 1 blog post. **Preview a Safari page:** `/en/site/<slug>?site=vilotest&preview=1&theme=safari` (home = `/en/site?site=vilotest&preview=1&theme=safari`). The test website id is `0b999999-9999-4999-8999-999999999991`; home page id `ffe05ac1-4cf4-402d-ab88-10b7e58aeacf`. Builder URL: `/en/website-editor/<websiteId>/pages/<pageId>`.

**▶ THE EPIC (founder directive, in order):** (1) app-wide click-feedback so no action feels dead + speed the app up — **DONE**; (2) make the pixel-perfect SAFARI theme (NenGama Lodge) EDITABLE in the page builder — pull each page template into the builder so the host edits content/images + pulls real rooms into slots, WITHOUT falling back to the generic design — **ALL 6 PAGES NOW SECTION-DRIVEN (home/about/rooms/contact/room-detail/rates + blog) — only the per-page styling/editability AUDIT remains (see the save point above).**

**✅ PHASE 1 DONE — app-wide tiered feedback + perf quick-wins.** Rule in RULES.md §4 "Every action gives immediate feedback". Primitives: global top bar (`nextjs-toploader`, root layout, brand green `#10B981`); labeled busy overlay `components/ui/busy-host.tsx` (`busy.during({title,message},fn)` + `busy.showNav` + `<BusyHost>`, mirrors `modal-host` external-store, clears nav overlays on pathname change); `<PendingLink>` `components/ui/pending-link.tsx` (heavy-route nav → "Opening the editor…" overlay, i18n router); builder skeleton `website-editor/[websiteId]/loading.tsx`. Wired: Pages-manager "Edit page" → PendingLink; Publish → busy.during. Perf: `next.config` optimizePackageImports + images.remotePatterns + staleTimes(120/300); `hostHasFeature` wrapped in React `cache()`. **TODO (easy, primitives ready):** apply `busy.during`/`PendingLink` to more surfaces (delete website/page, media upload, theme apply, blog/form editor opens). DEFERRED perf: `<img>`→next/image (esp. Safari — being reworked), next/dynamic for recharts + tiptap.

**✅ PHASE 2 — SAFARI HOME PAGE FULLY DONE (builder + editable + live===builder).**
- **Architecture:** each NenGama home band lives once in `components/site/sections/SafariSections.tsx` (hero/intro/highlights/rooms_preview→suites/gallery/reviews/location/cta + `renderSafariSection` dispatcher + `SafariSectionList`). Content from section props, stock fallback baked in, suites bind to REAL rooms (`RoomsPreviewData`), reviews to real review data.
- **Renderer:** `SectionRenderer`/`SectionSwitch` take `themeVariant`(+`safariCtx`); when `"safari"` they dispatch to the Safari bands (fallback to generic). ONE renderer → builder canvas + public site can't drift.
- **Builder canvas:** `PageBuilder.tsx` branches on `theme.preset==="safari"` → renders inside scoped `.vilo-safari` (+ theme fonts), each block Safari-styled & selectable; `safari.css` imported in the editor bundle. Non-safari themes untouched.
- **Public site unified:** `SafariSiteView` takes live `data`/`asset`/`SafariCtx` and renders the home via `SafariSectionList`; old hardcoded `SafariHomeContent` deleted (~520 lines). `SitePageView` threads `result.data`+`siteAsset`. VERIFIED in preview: public home shows real rooms.
- **Editability:** added additive optional props (NO migration) — `eyebrow` on hero/intro/highlights/location/cta; `image_path` on intro/location/cta + per-item on highlights; `subheading` on highlights; `body` on location — wired into `SectionEditor` (ImageField/TextField) + Safari bands. +i18n (fldEyebrow(Hint)/fldSubheading/fldImage(Hint)). VERIFIED: editing the eyebrow updates the canvas live.

**▶▶ ~~NEXT — the OTHER 6 SAFARI PAGES~~ ✅ DONE this session (2026-06-26) — see the save point at the top. The block below is the ORIGINAL plan, kept for reference (all of steps 1-2 are now complete; step 3 editability + the styling audit are the remaining NEXT, restated up top):**
Rooms, Room-detail, Rates, About, Contact, Journal still render HARDCODED `Safari*Content` on the PUBLIC site (the builder partially renders them via the home band types already). For each:
1. **Add Safari band variants** for the section types not yet mapped in `renderSafariSection`: `amenities`, `pricing`, `contact_form`, `faq`, `rate_table`, `room_rates`/`seasonal_pricing`, and the room-detail types `room_gallery`/`room_overview`/`room_amenities`/`room_rate` (extract markup from the corresponding `Safari*Content.tsx` + the `Room.html`/`Rooms.html`/`Contact.html` mockups).
2. **Switch public renders to `SafariSectionList`** — `SafariSiteView` cases (rooms/about/contact/rates) + the separate routes `site/rooms/[roomSlug]` (`SiteRoomView`, branches at `SiteRoomView.tsx:73`), `site/blog` + `site/blog/[postSlug]` (already bound to real posts — see below), `site/book`. Thread `data`/`room` like the home.
3. **Editability fields** for any newly-exposed content (mirror the home eyebrow/image pattern).
**Quickest first:** ABOUT then CONTACT (About reuses home band types: heroSplit/story/experiences/reviews/cta — all already mapped; Contact needs `contact_form`+`faq` variants). **THEN: styling audit** — per theme+page-template, HIDE controls that don't apply (e.g. the hero `overlay`/`overlayColor`/`overlayOpacity` controls do nothing on Safari — its hero uses the CSS `--hero-overlay` gradient) and FIX ones that should work. Founder wants this audit AFTER all pages are in.

**Also done this session (not Safari-builder):** Safari Contact page CSS ported (was unstyled); Safari blog index+article bound to REAL posts (`SafariJournalContent({posts})` / `SafariArticleContent({post})` — clicking a post now opens the real article); Pages-manager thumbnails show the page's featured image (first uploaded image in its sections — placeholder until one is uploaded). Still HARDCODED on Safari (theme character, candidates for the audit/editability sweep): hero stat row (12,000/Big Five/4.98), intro "2009" badge, suites/gallery section headings.

**ACTIVE LANE = the bespoke SAFARI theme** (NenGama Lodge design). Source mockups: `C:\Users\Wollie\Downloads\safari_theme_extract\NenGama Lodge\*.html` (+ `nengama.css`). Ported render layer lives in `apps/web/components/site/safari/` (`SafariShell`/`SafariNav`/`SafariSiteView`/`SafariLightbox` + `pages/Safari*Content.tsx` + `safari.css`). Preview a Safari page: `/en/site/<slug>?site=vilotest&preview=1&theme=safari`. **Recurring fidelity bug to watch:** each mockup HTML may carry a page-level `<style>` block that must be hand-ported into `safari.css` (scoped under `.vilo-safari`) — has bitten Room, Booking, and (now fixed) Contact. All mockup pages with inline `<style>` are ported now (Room/Booking/Contact/Thank-You done; About/Home/Journal/Rooms have none).

**LATEST (2026-06-26) — Safari Contact page styles ported + React warning fixed.** Contact.html's page-level `<style>` block (`contact-grid`/`detail-card`/`dc-row`/`map-ph`/`map-pin`/`map-tag`/`faq-item`/`pm`/`sent-msg`) was never ported → the Contact page rendered unstyled. Ported it into `safari.css` verbatim (scoped). Also fixed a React controlled-input warning (`value="3"`→`defaultValue="3"` on the nights field). Browser-verified end-to-end (2-col grid + responsive collapse ≤860px, striped map placeholder w/ ochre pin + tag, FAQ accordion plus→cross). tsc + lint green. See CHANGELOG 2026-06-26.

## ▶▶ PRIOR SAVE POINT (· 2026-06-25)

**Branch:** `main` — tsc + lint + **178 vitest** all GREEN + a full `pnpm build` exit 0 earlier (lint: only 2 pre-existing `<img>` warnings in `reports/_components`, untouched). ⚠️ **A managed dev server is RUNNING on :3000** (I restarted the founder's after a `.next` clobber — see note) → do NOT `pnpm build` while it's up.

**⚠️ DEV-SERVER NOTE (2026-06-25):** I ran `pnpm build` while verifying; it clobbered the shared `.next` and broke the founder's running :3000 dev server (`Cannot find module ./vendor-chunks/…`). Recovered per the documented gotcha: stopped the stuck process, `rm -rf apps/web/.next`, restarted a clean dev server (now serving on :3000). If the founder had unsaved terminal state it's unaffected (a dev server has none). **Lesson reinforced: never `pnpm build` while a dev server runs — verify with tsc/lint/vitest, and only build when :3000 is confirmed free.**

**LATEST (2026-06-25) — header builder pt.3: real-design card + logo controls (epic complete).** (1) Nav-manager header card now embeds a scaled/cropped iframe of the live preview (`LivePreviewFrame.tsx`) = true WYSIWYG; added `embed=1` mode (route→SitePageView→SiteChrome `hideBanner`) to suppress the preview banner in the card. Builder still uses live `NavHeaderPreview`. (2) Logo controls in header builder: `header.logoStyle` (wordmark/icon/mark) + `header.logoMaxHeight` (16–96px) — overrides Brand Studio per-header via `BrandLogo` styleOverride/heightOverride. Verified live (Name-only rendered name w/o mark). vilotest reset. This CLOSES the entire nav/header epic: layouts(pt1)+consolidation/colour/logo-toggle/menu-align(pt2)+real-card/logo-style-size(pt3)+rates page+menu colours. tsc+lint green.

**EARLIER (2026-06-25) — Rates page template.** Added "Rates" to `PAGE_TEMPLATES` + `PAGE_TEMPLATE_SECTIONS` (`rates: [intro, rate_table, cta]`) + i18n (`pageTemplate_rates`/desc). New-page picker auto-shows it. `rate_table` already pulls live property rates (loadRateTable) → neat table. Verified: created "Our Rates" page renders a `<table>` + Book CTA (200). Left a sample draft "Our Rates" page on vilotest (unpublished). This completes the multi-part nav/header epic: header builder pt1 (4 layouts) + pt2 (book consolidation/colour/logo/menu-align) + rates page. Menu colours/hover confirmed working by founder. tsc+lint green.

**EARLIER (2026-06-25) — header builder pt.2: book consolidation + colour/logo/menu-align.** Book button now controlled ONLY in the header builder (removed the duplicate toggle from MenuStudio Advanced → hint points to header). Added: `header.bookCtaColor` (BookCta bg), `header.showLogo` toggle (HeaderInspector; logo asset/style/size stay in Brand Studio), `menuStyle.align` start/center/end (MenuStudio Advanced → inline menu). Threaded `bookColor`/`showLogo`/`menuAlign` through SiteChrome HeaderInner. Verified live (colour, centering, logo toggle, book toggle gone from menu). vilotest reset. NOTE: the nav-manager overview header card now reflects layout+colours+book+alignment via the layout-aware `NavHeaderPreview` (close to "real design"; full SiteChrome render in the card is heavier, deferred). REMAINING: Rates page template (pull property rates into a table; `rate_table` section already pulls live rates — add a page template). tsc+lint green.

**EARLIER (2026-06-25) — header builder overhaul pt.1: 4 layouts + picker.** Agreed architecture: header builder owns header type/layout/visible-elements/transparency/BOOK BUTTON (single source); menu builder owns links; footer owns footer. Done: added `split` to `SiteHeaderLayout` (4 layouts: classic/centered/split/minimal) + `HeaderInner` split variant; new `navigation.header.layout` (schema+types, `SITE_HEADER_LAYOUT_NAMES` +split) — `SiteChrome` prefers it over `theme.header.desktop`; header section editor has a LEFT-sidebar layout picker (4 cards w/ diagrams in NavSectionEditor); `NavHeaderPreview` is layout-aware. Verified end-to-end (picker→save→front renders split). vilotest reset to classic. REMAINING (next increments): (1) header inspector — book button colour + display rules, menu alignment (start/center/end), logo controls, visible-element toggles; (2) CONSOLIDATION — remove the duplicate book toggle from MenuStudio Advanced (header = sole owner, per founder's choice); (3) nav-manager header card → real design; (4) Rates page template pulling property rates into a table (note: `rate_table` section already pulls live rates). tsc+lint green.

**EARLIER (2026-06-25) — room detail mosaic gallery + verified menu hover.** (A) Menu hover: re-verified the `?preview=1` front applies ALL 4 style settings — cascade enumeration shows `.vilo-hmenu a:hover{color:…}` is the sole winning hover rule + base colour applies (rgb(255,0,0)). Hover works on actual hover; the user's issue is a stale preview tab (must reload) / styling needs Publish for the non-preview live site. (B) Room gallery: new `mosaic` layout in shared `GalleryLightbox` (hero + 2×2 grid + "View all N photos" → fullscreen lightbox w/ prev/next), matching the directory `PhotoGallery`. Added to `ROOM_GALLERY_VARIANTS` + builder variant picker (`roomGalleryVariant_mosaic`) + theme template default (`themeSections.roomDetail.gallery` = mosaic). NOTE: `ensureRoomDetailPage` seeds room_detail ONCE → existing sites keep their variant (host switches in builder; new sites get mosaic). Updated vilotest's room template to mosaic + verified live (published + preview olive-room render mosaic, View all → lightbox prev/next). tsc+lint green.

**EARLIER (2026-06-25) — fix RE-APPLIED: menu styling class via array join.** The prior space-fix commit did NOT persist (committed `SiteChrome.tsx` still had `"vilo-hmenu"` no-space → still shipped `vilo-hmenuhidden`, hover + all menu styling still broken on front). Re-applied robustly: `className={[styled?"vilo-hmenu":"", className].filter(Boolean).join(" ")}` (commit 61228c8). VERIFIED in committed file via `git show HEAD` + live: all 4 Style settings (link colour, hover, weight, UPPERCASE) apply on front (nav.vilo-hmenu present, links match `.vilo-hmenu a`, hover rule targets them) AND middle preview. vilotest reset to defaults + republished. LESSON: after a 1-char fix, re-verify `git show HEAD:<file>` — a prior commit silently lost the edit. (Menu style still needs Publish to reach the live snapshot; preview reflects immediately.)

**EARLIER (2026-06-25) — fix: menu styling never applied on live site (class typo).** Root cause: `SiteChrome.MenuNav` `${styled?"vilo-hmenu":""}${className}` had NO space → `class="vilo-hmenuhidden lg:flex…"`, so `.vilo-hmenu` matched nothing and the scoped menu style (colour/HOVER/weight/uppercase) never applied on published/preview. (Also the true cause of the earlier "Style tab doesn't reflect on front" — prior check only confirmed CSS was emitted, not applied.) Fix: add the space (`"vilo-hmenu "`). Verified live: nav.vilo-hmenu exists, links match `.vilo-hmenu a`, base + hover rule apply. Also added hover-colour to the builder preview (`NavHeaderPreview` scoped `.nvhm-pv .nv-mi:hover` + `!important`). tsc+lint green; vilotest reset to defaults.

**EARLIER (2026-06-25) — nav builder: enabling auto-list auto-expands the item.** The inspector "Auto-list my rooms" toggle now calls `setOpen({[item.id]:true})` when enabled, so the room tabs populate under the item in the left tree immediately even if it was collapsed. Browser-verified (collapsed → re-enable → tabs reappear). tsc+lint green. (Builds on the prior nav-builder fix below.)

**EARLIER (2026-06-25) — nav builder: Style-tab preview + auto-room tabs in tree.** (1) `NavHeaderPreview` ignored `nav.menuStyle` → Style tab did nothing in the builder preview. Now applies link colour/weight/UPPERCASE to the `.nv-mi` preview items (added local `MENU_WEIGHT`). Front-end was already correct (scoped `.vilo-hmenu` style) — just needs Publish; verified red/uppercase published then reverted vilotest to default. (2) `MenuStudio` now shows auto-room link tabs nested under the Rooms item (expandable; each room a read-only child row with an inline Eye/EyeOff toggle writing `hiddenRoomIds`; hidden = struck-through). i18n `menuAutoRoomHide`/`menuAutoRoomShow`. tsc+lint+181 vitest green; browser-verified both.

**EARLIER (2026-06-25) — harden renderer: per-section error boundary (pass #2).** App had NO error boundary anywhere → one section throwing at render crashed the whole `SectionRenderer` tree (white-screened builder / broken public page). New `components/site/SectionBoundary.tsx` (client class boundary) wraps each section inside `SectionRenderer`: public site (no `errorLabel`) silently OMITS the bad section (page stays up); builder (passes `errorLabel={t("sectionRenderError")}`) shows a fixable notice in its place; boundary auto-resets when the section object changes (host edits it). Threaded `errorLabel` from PageBuilder's 2 canvas render calls; new i18n key `sectionRenderError`. Verified no regression (18 builder sections, public 200). tsc+lint+181 vitest green.

**EARLIER (2026-06-25) — harden builder: autosave data-loss race.** Page builder hardening pass #1 (theme/template VISUAL designs are ON HOLD — user is supplying a design; only harden/refine the builder for now). Bug: an edit made while a draft save was in flight got silently dropped — the older save resolved, cleared `dirty`, cancelled the newer edit's pending save + marked "All changes saved" (back link is client nav, no beforeunload → edit lost on navigate). Fix in `PageBuilder.tsx`: each save captures its snapshot and clears `dirty`/`navDirty` only if `sectionsRef.current`/`navConfigRef.current` still === that snapshot; added `navConfigRef`. Applied to sections autosave, chrome autosave, and ⌘/Ctrl+S `saveNow`. Happy path unchanged. Browser-verified edit→saving→"All changes saved". Remaining hardening candidates noted: autosave has no retry after a transient network error (only retries on next edit); `changeLayout` has no in-flight re-entrancy guard.

**EARLIER (2026-06-25) — fix: room pages 404'd in the preview tab.** Room links dropped `preview=1` → room route loaded non-preview → 404 for unpublished/draft. Fix in `loadSitePage.ts`: `siteRoomHref` now adds `&preview=1` (+`?site=`) when `ctx.preview` (for room CARDS, which bypass buildNavHref); `roomMenuLinks` now returns a CLEAN `/rooms/<slug>` (header MenuLink's `buildNavHref` adds /site+site+preview itself — baking it too double-encoded the menu URL). Verified in preview: menu + card room links render the room-detail template (no 404). tsc+lint+181 vitest green.

**EARLIER (2026-06-25) — auto-rooms menu dropdown (always up to date) + per-room hide.** The Rooms item is now `autoRooms`: children resolved LIVE at render from current rooms (label=`property_rooms.name`, href=`/rooms/<slug>`), with `hiddenRoomIds` to hide individual rooms (still on site). `SiteMenuItem`+`autoRooms`/`hiddenRoomIds` (schema+types). `roomMenuLinks(ctx)` + `expandAutoRooms()` in loadSitePage; applied in `loadSiteContext` (public+preview). Dropdown only when ≥2 visible. Builder: "Auto rooms" badge + inspector "Auto-list my rooms" toggle + per-room show/hide checkboxes (nav editor page now loads `rooms`, threads to MenuStudio). Default seed flags Rooms `autoRooms:true`. Verified live: hid Vineyard Suite → published header dropdown = Olive Room + Mountain Loft (Vineyard still in room cards). `defaultMenu.test.ts` updated (suite 181). tsc+lint green.

**EARLIER (2026-06-25) — default menu nests room detail pages under "Rooms".** When a site has ≥2 visible rooms, `ensureDefaultMenu` seeds each room's `/rooms/<slug>` as a sub-item under the Rooms menu item. `visibleRoomLinks(supabase, websiteId)` in `lib/website/defaultMenu.ts` (reuses exported `roomSlugMap` from loadSitePage for slug parity); `buildDefaultMenu(pages, roomLinks)` attaches them to the rooms page item. Only on empty-menu seed; single-room → no dropdown. `defaultMenu.test.ts` (3 cases, suite 179→182). Verified live (cleared vilotest menu → reseeded Rooms ▾ Olive Room/Vineyard Suite/Mountain Loft). tsc+lint green.

**EARLIER (2026-06-25) — Elementor-style menu builder + 2-level dropdowns + menu styling.** New `MenuStudio` (website-editor/.../navigation/[section]/MenuStudio.tsx), rendered by `NavSectionEditor` for the `menu` section: LEFT = 3 tabs (Links tree w/ add/reorder/nest + which-pages quick-add · Style: color/hover/weight/uppercase · Advanced: collapse+show-book) · CENTER = device preview · RIGHT = selected-link inspector (label/link/page/new-tab/delete). 2-level nesting: `menuItemSchema` children→children (top→sub→subsub); public desktop dropdown groups sub-sub as a column; mobile drawer nests in accordion. `navigation.menuStyle` (color/hoverColor/weight/uppercase) applied via scoped `.vilo-hmenu` <style> in SiteChrome (defaults = current look). schema+types updated. `MenuBuilder` still used by PageBuilder inline chrome (1-level). Browser-verified. tsc+lint+179 vitest green.

**EARLIER (2026-06-25) — nav editor device-aware preview + book-button control.** (a) `NavHeaderPreview` is now device-aware (desktop=inline menu+CTA; tablet/phone=☰ per `menuCollapse`); `NavSectionEditor` passes the selected device → host edits/sees the menu per screen size. (b) New `navigation.header.showBookCta` (default true) + "Show 'Book now' button" toggle in `HeaderInspector`. (c) Header book button hides below the collapse breakpoint (`bookVisibilityClass` in SiteChrome) — ☰ replaces it on mobile/tablet; drawer carries it. Verified 375px (book hidden+burger) & 1100px (book shown). schema+types updated. tsc+lint+179 vitest green.

**EARLIER (2026-06-25) — working mobile/tablet nav + collapse control.** New `components/site/SiteMobileMenu.tsx` (themed hamburger → slide-in drawer; sub-items expand as an accordion; Book CTA; closes on tap/backdrop/X/Esc). New `HeaderMenu` wrapper in `SiteChrome` shows the full inline menu (desktop hover-dropdowns) at/above the breakpoint, hamburger below; `minimal` header variant always uses the hamburger. Host control `navigation.header.menuCollapse` (mobile|tablet|never) via a select in `HeaderInspector` (schema + `SiteNavigation.header` updated). Browser-verified 375px (drawer) + 1100px (inline). Desktop dropdowns + MenuBuilder sub-item editing already existed. tsc+lint+179 vitest green.

**EARLIER (2026-06-25) — alt text on listing/room photos.** Host Media manager "Listings & rooms" tiles now open an image detail modal to edit alt + delete (matches website-media editor) — every image supports alt now. Listing-photo alt = `property_photos.caption` (the public-render alt), saved via new `setListingPhotoCaptionAction`. Round-trip verified in-browser. tsc+lint green.

**EARLIER (2026-06-25) — Host-wide Media manager** at `/dashboard/media`, linked as the LAST item in the Properties sidebar group (`Sidebar.tsx`, `Images` icon). Dedicated host-level manager (outside the website CMS), same design via dashboard brand palette. `HostMediaManager` has 2 views: **Website media** (all assets across ALL the host's websites — `loadHostMedia` lists each site's storage + alt; site filter, search, upload→primary site, alt-edit/delete) + **Listings & rooms** (pick listing → "Listing photos (directory)" or a room → add/delete via the listing-editor photo actions on `property_photos`/`listing-photos`). Owner-scoped by `host_id`. Browser-verified logged in. tsc+lint+179 vitest green.

**EARLIER (2026-06-25) — Media manager (website CMS tab) + per-room galleries + clickable room header + default menu** (browser-verified on `vilotest`, logged in). Migration `20260625010000` adds `website_rooms.media_overrides` jsonb (types regen). (a) **Media tab** (between Pages/Blog, `(editor)/media`): Library (grid, search by name+alt, upload, alt-edit via new `updateWebsiteMediaAltAction`, delete) + Room galleries (per-room hide/add via `saveRoomMediaOverridesAction`). (b) **Per-room overrides** in `lib/website/roomMedia.ts` (`{hidden,extra}`); `loadRoomDetail` filters hidden + appends extras; frozen in snapshot (`SnapshotRoom.media_overrides`). (c) **Clickable room gallery** — `room_gallery` renders via `GalleryLightbox`. (d) **Default menu** — `ensureDefaultMenu` (`lib/website/defaultMenu.ts`) lazily seeds an editable menu from pages when the host opens Navigation. NOTE: sub-menu **dropdowns already worked** (MenuBuilder children + public hover dropdowns) — left as-is. Full detail in CHANGELOG (2026-06-25 "Media manager…"). tsc+lint+179 vitest green. **A managed dev server is running on :3000** (don't `pnpm build` while up).

**ALSO (2026-06-25) — theme activation now REQUIRES a room-detail template + seeds it.** `hasThemeRoomDetailTemplate(slug)` (all 7 built-ins true); `applyThemeAction` blocks activation with `no_room_template` (fails before any mutation; restore-point capture moved after the gate) and the activate modal shows `themeNoRoomTemplate`. On activation the reseed also seeds the `room_detail` page via `getThemeRoomDetailSections(slug)` so the room layout fits the active theme. tsc+lint+179 vitest green.

**THIS SESSION (2026-06-25) — Website CMS: individual ROOM DETAIL pages (every theme).** Room cards used to jump to checkout; they now open `/rooms/<room-slug>` showing that room's photos/details/amenities/rate + a "Book this room" CTA into checkout. Every theme ships a designed, host-editable room-detail template. Browser-verified on `vilotest`. Full detail in CHANGELOG (2026-06-25 "individual room detail pages"). Key pieces: migration `20260625000000` (widen `website_pages.kind` CHECK +`room_detail`, APPLIED to cloud); 4 new room-scoped section types (`room_gallery`/`room_overview`/`room_amenities`/`room_rate`, additive jsonb); public route `site/rooms/[roomSlug]` + `SiteRoomView` + `RoomDetailSections.tsx`; `loadRoomDetail`/`loadRoomDetailSections`/`loadSiteRoomPage`/`listRoomSlugs` + `RoomCard.detailHref` in `loadSitePage.ts`; `getThemeRoomDetailSections` per theme in `themeSections.ts`; lazy-created `room_detail` page (Pages manager) editable in the builder (new "Room detail" palette group + sample-room preview + `SectionEditor` inspectors); `buildRoomJsonLd` (HotelRoom+breadcrumb) + canonical + sitemap. **Room amenities fall back to property-level amenities when a room has none.**

**FOUNDER GRANTED standing permission (2026-06-25) to install required FREE deps without asking** (saved to memory `install-free-deps-allowed`; still surface paid ones).

**THIS SESSION (2026-06-25) — builder polish, three parts (all additive, NO migration):**
- **Contact templates for every theme** — 3 makers (`contactForm`/`faq`/`location`) + Contact form & FAQ presets + a **Contact** template per theme.
- **WYSIWYG inline links** — `rich_text` tiptap editor got a **Link** button (new free dep `@tiptap/extension-link@^2.10.0`). **Sanitiser hardened** (`lib/sanitiseHtml.ts`): now allows `<a>` but restricts schemes to http(s)/mailto/tel (relative/#anchor pass; `javascript:`/`data:` dropped) and FORCES `rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"`+`target="_blank"` on every link — applies to page-builder rich_text, listing descriptions AND blog bodies. New `lib/sanitiseHtml.test.ts` (8 cases).
- **Rooms + Blog templates for every theme** — 3 more makers (`amenities`/`pricing`/`blog`) + Amenities/Rates/Blog-posts presets + **Rooms** (`rooms→amenities→rates→CTA`) and **Blog** (`blog→CTA`) templates. Themes now ship **Home/About/Contact/Rooms/Blog**.

All in `lib/website/themeSections.ts` (+test); surfaced automatically via the registry — NO PageBuilder change. Suite 133→169. **NOT browser-QA'd** (rolls into manual QA).

**SESSION RESUMED (2026-06-25):** Also picked up an interrupted prior session that built 3 features (commits `4867092`/`8538683`/`9c7e50c`) but was cut off before finishing the Definition of Done — CHANGELOG + this save point weren't updated and `9c7e50c` wasn't pushed. Verified all 3 commits green + sound, back-filled CHANGELOG, then PUSHED (origin/main reached `9d68eba`).

**THE 3 NEWLY-DOCUMENTED COMMITS:**
- `4867092` — **reorder section items** (`ItemListEditor` up/down for all multi-item sections) + **WYSIWYG rich_text** (tiptap `RichTextEditor` replaces the raw-HTML textarea; same `sanitiseListingHtml` chokepoint; inline-link button is a follow-up needing `@tiptap/extension-link`).
- `8538683` — **undo/redo + keyboard shortcuts** in the builder (snapshot history; structural edits = discrete steps, typing coalesces over 700ms; Ctrl/Cmd+Z/Y/S, Delete removes selected section; native undo preserved in text fields).
- `9c7e50c` — **delete-website** (`deleteWebsiteAction`, owner-scoped soft-delete `deleted_at`+unpublish, never hard-deleted per AGENT_RULES) + Settings danger-zone control. **← this is the unpushed one.**

**EARLIER (same prior session group) — NEXT #1 DONE: designed sections + page templates for ALL built-in themes.** `lib/website/themeSections.ts` previously shipped designed presets/templates for Aria only; now all 6 other active catalogue themes (`classic`/`modern`/`coastal`/`warm`/`minimal`/`nightfall`) each get **5 section presets + Home/About templates**, tuned to the theme's voice/hero-variant/tone (styling still from the theme `base`/`buildSiteVars`). Added a type-safe `build<T>()` helper (Aria output unchanged). Registry keyed by slug → the builder picks them up via the existing `getThemeSectionPresets`/`getThemeTemplates` (`theme.preset`), **no PageBuilder change**. ADDITIVE — pre-configured instances of existing curated section types, **NO migration/DB/schema change**. New `themeSections.test.ts` (37 cases) parses every preset+template through `sectionSchema` (suite 96→133). tsc+lint green. **NOT yet browser-QA'd** (rolls into NEXT #5 manual QA).

**Verify commands:** `cd apps/web && pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` + `pnpm next lint --file …` + `pnpm exec vitest run`. **`pnpm build` ONLY when no dev server is running** (it shares `.next`); if a build dies with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`/webpack-runtime, `rm -rf apps/web/.next` and rebuild.

**🔑 TEST FIXTURE (use for all manual + QA testing):** `cd apps/web && pnpm seed:test-site` (idempotent, hits the linked cloud DB). Logs in: **host@vilotest.com / ViloTest123!** (+ guest@vilotest.com). Gives 1 guesthouse property "Olive Grove Guesthouse" (flexible, base R2600/wknd R2900, cleaning R450) + 3 rooms + photos + 4 reviews + 7 bookings (mixed statuses, invoices generated) + a PUBLISHED Aria-theme website (subdomain `vilotest`) + blog post + contact form + 14 days of analytics events. Live tenant site: `http://localhost:<port>/en/site?site=vilotest`.

**WHAT THIS SESSION DID (all committed + pushed to main; see CHANGELOG 2026-06-22 for per-commit detail):**

**A) Flagged correctness/security fixes (all verified, mostly live-tested vs cloud DB):**
- **Email/push worker double-send → FIXED** (migration `20260622010000`: `claimed_at` + `claim_email_queue_batch`/`claim_push_queue_batch` SECURITY DEFINER RPCs, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` + 300s stale-reclaim; `drain.ts`/`push-queue.ts` claim atomically). Verified `scripts/smoke-queue-claim.mjs`.
- **Digest drain race → FIXED** (`runDigestDrain` claim-first).
- **convertQuoteAction over-credit → FIXED** (adopt path completes ONLY the deposit row, not all pending).
- **report-scheduler + track-listing-view edge fns → FIXED + DEPLOYED + live-verified.** report-scheduler: fail-closed `x-report-scheduler-secret` gate (migration `20260622020000`, fn deployed, `REPORT_SCHEDULER_SECRET` set; 401 without / 200 with). track-listing-view: input validation (uuid/enum/clamp), deployed, live-verified sanitised insert.
- **CALENDAR SYNC (founder "make double sure") — found + fixed a CRITICAL bug:** iCal import was 100% broken — `syncIcalFeedAction` upserted with `onConflict:"property_id,date"` but no such unique key exists (only the expression index `unique_blocked_date_per_scope`) → every sync died with Postgres `42P10`, no external date ever blocked. Migration `20260622030000` adds SECURITY DEFINER RPC `import_ical_blocks` (atomic, **non-destructive `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`** so booking/manual/quote_hold blocks always win); action calls it. Verified live (`scripts/smoke-ical-import.mjs`: inserts, preserves a manual block, idempotent). Export route now 503s cleanly when `ICAL_TOKEN_SECRET` unset. Added 23 iCal unit tests. **Confirmed already-safe:** Paystack webhook idempotency + overpayment-credit dedup (amount-verification still needs live Paystack).

**B) PAGE-BUILDER REFINEMENT (founder-driven, big lane — all preset-based/brand-safe, additive jsonb, NO migrations):**
- **Per-element styling** — heading/text size+weight+colour, button size, spacer xs–2xl, divider thickness.
- **Block layout controls** — side padding, margin, border+theme-colour, radius, max-width, **section height** (Frame group in block-style panel).
- **7 professional hero layouts** (Spotlight/Split-right/Split-left/Full-screen/Minimal/Boxed/Search) + overlay/text-tone/height controls; Search hero has a deep-link booking bar. Legacy `classic`/`split` kept as aliases.
- **Searchable add-blocks sidebar** + the 7 heroes as pickable cards.
- **Site width (boxed vs full)** — `SiteContext.layout`+`PublishSnapshot.layout`, `SiteChrome` boxed wrapper, threaded into SitePageView+blog+book; Full/Boxed toggle in the builder header (dedicated `setWebsiteLayoutAction`).
- **Theme-attached sections + page templates** (Phase C) — code-defined registry `lib/website/themeSections.ts` (`getThemeSectionPresets`/`getThemeTemplates`); **Aria** ships designed sections (sidebar "Aria" group) + Home/About page templates (gallery via "Templates" button + empty-canvas affordance). Add a theme's set = one registry entry.
- **Builder inspector UI fixes** — added a 16px gutter; **ImageField stacks** (full-width preview above wrapped buttons) + scoped CSS forces all right-panel field grids to single column (no more side-by-side overflow).

**▶ NEXT (start here):**
1. **Page builder — theme content: ✅ all 7 built-in themes now ship designed presets + Home/About/Contact/Rooms/Blog templates** (`lib/website/themeSections.ts`; Contact/Rooms/Blog + WYSIWYG inline-link button all added 2026-06-25). Optional follow-on (founder-call): per-theme preview thumbnails in the sidebar/template gallery, more section kinds, or a tone/colour picker for link styling on the public site.
2. **Calendar sync follow-ups:** (a) set **`ICAL_TOKEN_SECRET`** in Vercel so export feeds work; (b) **no 15-min auto-sync cron exists** — import is manual-only ("Sync now"/on-add); build `ical-sync-all` (Next API route + pg_cron, mirror the email-worker pattern) if you want hands-off syncing.
3. **report-scheduler launch step (privileged — needs founder SQL Editor):** `ALTER DATABASE postgres SET app.report_scheduler_secret='…'` (match the fn secret) + `app.settings.supabase_url` + `app.settings.supabase_anon_key` so the hourly cron fires (security gate already live/fail-closed; reporting gen is still a TODO placeholder).
4. **Flagged item still needing LIVE KEYS:** card/webhook **amount-verification** (`event.data.amount` == expected `payment.amount`*100) — untestable without Paystack keys.
5. **Remaining manual QA:** founder click-through of the builder (new controls/heroes/sidebar/site-width/templates) + dashboard mutations + property-edit round-trips → punch-list.

**OPS switches still off (inert-until-set in Vercel, not bugs):** `ICAL_TOKEN_SECRET` (calendar **export** feeds — import works without it), `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN` + wildcard DNS (subdomains), `VERCEL_TOKEN/PROJECT_ID/TEAM_ID` (custom domains), `TURNSTILE_*`, host-set GA4/Pixel, `RESEND_API_KEY` + `app.email_worker_url`/`app.email_worker_secret` (notification send), live Paystack/PayPal keys, `app.report_scheduler_secret` + `app.settings.supabase_url`/`supabase_anon_key` (report cron — see NEXT #3).

**Dev-tooling gotcha:** the husky/lint-staged pre-commit SILENTLY reverts a LONE bracketed-path file (`[locale]`/`[id]`) commit as "empty commit" — commit it alongside another file (e.g. CHANGELOG) or `--no-verify`. Commit subjects must start lowercase after the type (commitlint).

## ▶ ACTIVE LANE: Website CMS — PRODUCTION READINESS (· 2026-06-22)

**Branch:** `main` — working tree CLEAN, all work committed (latest `5afa8e4`). Dev server: `cd apps/web && PORT=3001 pnpm dev` → http://localhost:3001 (tenant site via `/en/site?site=<subdomain>`). **GOTCHA: do NOT run `pnpm build` while the dev server is up — it clobbers the shared `.next` and breaks the running server. Verify with `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` + `pnpm next lint --file …` only.**

**The PREMIUM REDESIGN is COMPLETE** (all 8 mockup tabs + full-screen editors + Elementor-but-simple builder [free elements + per-block responsive style w/ accurate device preview + columns] + unified inline header/footer/menu editing in the builder + Brand button + Site-parts palette). Detail in the historical log below + CHANGELOG (2026-06-21/22) + MEMORY.md. **Verified: full `pnpm build` exit 0, app-wide lint clean, tsc green, themes-compat 🎉.**

**▶ NEW GOAL: get the Website CMS production-ready.** Founder wants to follow the readiness plan below (assessment given 2026-06-22). Current state = **feature-complete, NOT production-hardened (~70%)**. Work the gates in order:

1. **MANUAL/LIVE QA PASS (do FIRST — #1 risk).** Almost ALL recent work (esp. the deep-fold inline chrome editing + the builder) was verified by tsc/lint/build, **NOT by clicking through a real browser**. Drive `localhost:3001` and exercise: page builder (add/edit/reorder EVERY section type + the 6 free elements + columns + per-block desktop/tablet/mobile style + tone/visibility/schedule); inline header/footer/menu editing (click chrome → edit → autosave → publish); Pages/Blog/Forms managers + their full-screen editors; Domain/SEO/Settings tabs; Brand button round-trip; on-site checkout (real booking → card + EFT) + forms submit → inbox; publish flow + live tenant render; desktop + mobile. Fix what breaks. (Can use Claude-in-Chrome / Preview MCP, but needs a logged-in host + a seeded test website.) **✅ QA FIXTURE READY (2026-06-22):** `pnpm seed:test-site` seeds host `host@vilotest.com` / `ViloTest123!` + 1 guesthouse property + 3 rooms + reviews + 7 bookings + a PUBLISHED aria-theme website (subdomain `vilotest`). Live site renders at `http://localhost:3001/en/site?site=vilotest` (verified 200). **✅ Booking-confirm blocker FIXED** (migration `20260622000000` — `on_booking_confirmed_create_invoice()` now delegates to the business-based `ensure_booking_invoice`; pushed): seeded bookings transition confirmed/completed + generate invoices (verified). `seed-demo.mjs` also de-staled (`listings`→`properties` + business-scoped banking/properties) and runs clean.
2. **Security + bot-hardening.** ✅ **Turnstile DONE (2026-06-22):** `lib/security/turnstile.ts` (`verifyTurnstile`, inert until `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` set, fail-closed once set) + `components/site/TurnstileWidget.tsx` (inert until `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` set) wired into `/api/website-form-submit` + `/api/site-booking` and all 3 client surfaces (FormSection, SitePopup PopupForm, SiteCheckoutForm); read-only quote/availability NOT gated; env documented. ✅ **Audited:** no service-role key client-side; the `SiteChrome editable` path is builder-only/inert on public (`ChromeEditWrap` returns children verbatim when `editable` undefined; only `PageBuilder.tsx:736` sets it). ✅ **Baseline security headers DONE (2026-06-22):** `next.config.mjs` `headers()` sets X-Frame-Options:SAMEORIGIN (not DENY — Brand Studio/preview iframe own pages), X-Content-Type-Options:nosniff, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy (camera/mic off, geolocation self), HSTS max-age=1yr (no includeSubDomains — protects custom-domain tenants). **⚠️ STILL TODO this gate:** the **CSP** (deferred to land with Step-1 live QA so it can be browser-validated against Paystack/PayPal/Supabase/OSM/YouTube/Turnstile/GA4/Meta; use `frame-ancestors 'self'`); confirm RLS coverage on prod (run the §2 `pg_tables` query); confirm Paystack/PayPal webhook sigs against prod. Needs founder to add `TURNSTILE_*` env keys to activate.
3. **Ops / domains / payments / gates.** Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN` + wildcard DNS so tenant subdomains/custom domains work for real (today only `?site=`); verify custom-domain DNS/SSL provisioning. Payments: live Paystack/PayPal keys + webhook verification confirmed against prod endpoints. **Flip the pre-MVP feature gates** (AGENT_RULES §3.4 — gates short-circuit to `true` + every plan open; must flip so plans actually gate) + seed real `plan_features`.
4. **Lower priority:** ✅ **GA4 + Meta Pixel + POPIA cookie-consent DONE (2026-06-22):** `settings.analytics` block (GA4 + Meta Pixel IDs + consent gate) in Website→Settings; public `components/site/SiteMarketing.tsx` injects the pixels only after consent (inert in preview), threaded via `SiteChrome`/`ctx.analytics`; frozen into the publish snapshot like conversion. **Remaining lower-priority:** a thin E2E smoke test for booking + publish (CMS test coverage ≈ 0 today — only `lib/site/host.test.ts` + `lib/website/subdomain.test.ts`) · other deferred Settings features (password protection, maintenance mode, delete-website, editable general lang/tz/currency).

**▶ DOMAINS / OPS NOTE (founder asked 2026-06-22):** temp subdomains (`<sub>.vilo.site`) + custom domains are **already code-complete** (middleware classifier `lib/site/host.ts` + the Vercel Domains API flow in `lib/website/vercel.ts`/Domain tab) — they are dormant on OPS only: set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN` + wildcard DNS (subdomains) and `VERCEL_TOKEN`/`VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`/`VERCEL_TEAM_ID` + Vault secret (custom domains). See `WEBSITE_HOSTING.md`. **Domain RESELLING ("buy a domain through Vilo", systeme.io-style) is NET-NEW and NOT started** — needs a founder decision on the registrar model (Vercel domain-purchase API vs a registrar reseller like Namecheap) before any build; it also implies Paystack billing for the domain + a custom_domain plan gate. No code written for reselling yet.

**Founder is following this sequencing. Start a fresh session at step 1 (live QA) unless the founder redirects to a specific gate (e.g. Turnstile or the security pass).**

## ▶ COMPLETED LANE (historical): Website CMS — PREMIUM REDESIGN to mockups (· 2026-06-21→22)

**Branch:** `main` — all work committed, working tree clean; full `pnpm build` exit 0.

**Goal:** redesign the whole Website CMS to the founder's pixel mockups + a simple in-page builder. **Mockup HTML files live in `C:\Users\Wollie\Downloads\*.html`** (Page Builder A · Pages Manager (2) · Forms Manager · Form Editor · Navigation Manager · Blog Manager · Blog Post Editor · Domain Manager · SEO Manager · Website Settings · Website CMS C). READ these for fidelity — the plain "Pages Manager.html"/"Website Settings.html" 1.4MB files are iframe wrappers; use the numbered/real ones.

**Design system (built):** scoped CSS — `.vilo-cms` (dashboard tab pages) · `.vilo-builder` (full-screen editors) · `.vilo-nav` (nav previews). Generated `cms.css`/`builder.css`/`nav.css` + hand-authored `cms-extra.css` under `app/[locale]/dashboard/website/`; full-screen editors under `app/[locale]/website-editor/` with `blog-editor.css` + `form-editor.css`. Builder engine = **@dnd-kit (already installed)** over the curated section model (NOT an element tree). **Founder rules:** build on dnd-kit; **NO fake/dead toggles for unbuilt features** (omit instead); match mockups closely; editors are FULL-SCREEN.

**DONE & committed this session group (premium redesign):**
- Foundation (scoped CSS) · shared shell (subheader site-switcher + emerald `.ctab` tab bar + PublishBar `.btn`)
- **Blog tab** + full-screen **Blog editor** · **Domain tab** · **SEO tab** · **Rooms tab REMOVED** (rooms auto-pull into `website_rooms` on publish via `reconcileWebsiteRooms`)
- **Navigation**: manager (3 cards + live `.vilo-nav` previews) + 3 full-screen editors (`website-editor/[websiteId]/navigation/[section]` header|menu|footer); old `NavigationForm` deleted
- **Page builder**: full-screen palette·canvas·inspector·3-view·preview at `website-editor/[websiteId]/pages/[pageId]`, true to Page Builder A (re-houses the existing `SectionBuilder` engine — dnd-kit + `SectionRenderer` live canvas + `SectionEditor` inspector) + **Pages manager** `.ptr` table
- **Forms COMPLETE**: manager `FormsList` (3 stat cards + filter + table + **derived tracking** [status=embedded-in-published-page, embedLabels, submissions month/last — NO migration]) + full-screen **15-type editor** `website-editor/[websiteId]/forms/[formId]` (palette/canvas/inspector, true to Form Editor.html) + public `FormSection` render + submit. `forms.schema.ts` expanded 7→17 types ADDITIVELY (jsonb, no migration). Old inline `FormsManager` + dashboard `forms/[formId]` route DELETED.
- **Settings**: premium `.sblock/.setrow` layout, real controls only (Branding/conversion settings/Access/Danger-zone publish-unpublish)

**▶ OVERVIEW DONE (2026-06-21):** `(editor)/page.tsx` rebuilt to `Website CMS C.html` (`.vilo-cms`): **portfolio "All websites" grid** (`loadOverviewData` now returns `portfolio[]` = every owner-scoped `host_websites` site + per-site real traffic [visitors/pageviews/booking-clicks] from ONE grouped `website_analytics_events` query; `.sitecard`s w/ glyph+status+"Viewing"+3 stat tiles; "New website"→`/dashboard/website`) + Performance header (glyph+name+RangeTabs) + chart card (visitors+`.delta`+`TrafficChart`+3-col footer) + KPI rail (Booking clicks/Conv rate/Pages-per-visit — **NO revenue/leads**, not tracked) + Top pages (`.lrow`/`.barmini`) + Sources (real %) + Devices + existing checklist/needs-attention/image-perf restyled to `.card`. **OMITTED per founder rule:** booking-funnel strip, revenue/leads KPIs (no fake data). All metrics = real pipeline. +8 i18n. NO DB change. tsc+lint green. (`CopyLinkButton` now orphaned — harmless.)

**▶ FREE ELEMENTS — SLICE 1 DONE (2026-06-21):** 6 free-element block types added ADDITIVELY (same flat section list, no element tree, no migration). `sections.schema.ts` +`el_heading`/`el_text`/`el_image`/`el_button`/`el_spacer`/`el_divider` (+`SECTION_TYPES`, union, props); `sectionDefaults` starters; public `components/site/sections/Elements.tsx` (theme-aware `--site-*`; `el_image` uses `SiteImg` + a builder-only placeholder when empty); `SectionRenderer` cases; `SectionEditor` cases (+shared `AlignField`); palette group "Elements" + ICONS in `PageBuilder` (and `SectionLibrary` modal); `SectionThumb` schematics; `seoAnalyzer` TEXT_KEYS +`text`/`alt`. +46 i18n. tsc+lint+themes-compat green.

**▶ FREE ELEMENTS — SLICE 2 DONE (2026-06-21) → PAGE-BUILDER "ELEMENTOR-BUT-SIMPLE" PHASE COMPLETE.** Two parts, both additive (no migration):
- **Per-block responsive style** (commit `f6f22c4`): optional `sectionBase.style?` = `background` (CSS colour, all viewports) + desktop/tablet/mobile `{padTop,padBottom}` (none/sm/md/lg/xl). `SectionWrap` emits a scoped `<style>` (class `wsec-<id>`) w/ viewport media queries (≤1024 tablet, ≤640 mobile) + merges bg over tone; helper `blockStyleCss` in `sections/_shared.tsx`. Inspector `BlockStyleEditor` (self-contained device sub-toggle + space-above/below selects + colour picker). NOTE: builder device frames are an APPROXIMATION for the responsive spacing (same as existing `visibility`); correct on the live site. **Future option:** container queries (`container-type:inline-size` on `.device` + public content wrapper) would make the builder preview exact.
- **Columns container** (commit pending): `columns` section type — bounded SINGLE-LEVEL (1–4 columns, each `{blocks: ColumnBlock[]}`, `ColumnBlock`=heading|text|image|button discriminated on `kind`; +gap/align/optional heading). Public `components/site/sections/ColumnsSection.tsx` (responsive grid, theme-aware inline blocks, `SiteImg`/`SiteButton`). Inspector `ColumnsEditor`+`ColumnBlockEditor` (count/gap/align + per-column add/edit/move/remove). Palette "Columns" (`Columns3` icon) + thumb. SEO walk already covers nested text via generic recursion.

**▶ IN-BUILDER PAGE SETTINGS DONE (2026-06-21) → OLD ROUTE RETIRED.** Full-screen `PageBuilder` got a "Page settings" toolbar button → `FormModal` reusing the existing `PageSeoCard` (per-page seo_overrides title/desc/focus-keyword + Google + social preview + `SeoAnalysis` Yoast coach, saves via `savePageSeoAction`) + `A11yCard` (live a11y score over current sections). SEO keyword-in-body check uses LIVE `extractSectionsText(sections)` (recomputed as host edits). New props threaded from `loadPageBuilder` (already returned): `pageSlug`/`pageSeo`/`domain`/`ogImageUrl`. +3 i18n. **DELETED legacy route** `(editor)/pages/[pageId]/page.tsx` + `SectionBuilder.tsx` + `DeviceFrame.tsx` (+stale `.next/types`). KEPT (shared, reused by full-screen builder): `_components/` (SectionEditor/Library/Thumb/fields/SeoAnalysis/SocialPreview/PageSeoCard/A11yCard) + `loadPageBuilder.ts`. tsc+lint green.

**▶ POLISH + NAV-FOLD (2026-06-22, founder "do all three in order, start with polish"):**
- **Container-query device preview** (commit `bea0c02`): `blockStyleCss` now emits BOTH `@media` (live site) AND `@container (max-width 1024/640)` rules; builder `.device` is a query container (`container-type:inline-size`) so the device toggle previews per-block spacing EXACTLY. `@container` inert on the public site (no ancestor container) → zero live-site risk.
- **Tab bar → canonical 8** (commit `80cac50`): `WebsiteTabs` trimmed to Overview·Pages·Blog·Navigation·Forms·Domain·SEO·Settings (dropped Themes+Brand tabs); Theme+Brand reached via Settings→Branding (Brand Studio + new "Open themes" link, `themeHref`) + Overview checklist. Routes still exist.
- **Nav editors → builder shell** (commit `eb4e57c`): `NavSectionEditor` canvas swapped to shared `.canvas-wrap`+`.device` frame + device toggle `.seg` (cosmetic; nav data/save unchanged).
- **Nav reorder → dnd-kit engine** (commit `23f38af`): new `navigation/SortableList.tsx` (page builder's `@dnd-kit` drag, render-prop handle); `MenuBuilder` items + `FooterBuilder` columns now drag-reorder (nested children/links keep up/down). No public-render/data change.

**▶ DEEP-FOLD DONE (commit `59c8771`, founder "just do it — foundation solid").** Built the SAFE way (NOT the risky "header/footer as public WebsiteSections + SiteChrome rewrite + snapshot migration"): **header/menu/footer are edited INLINE in the page-builder canvas.** `SiteChrome` gained an optional `editable` prop (`ChromeEditable`/`ChromeTarget`) → builder-only `ChromeEditWrap` makes header+footer click-to-select (ring+label, links inert via pointer-events:none); **undefined on public = children verbatim, ZERO change** (verified: early `if(!editable) return <>{children}</>`). Shared `navigation/NavInspectors.tsx` (HeaderInspector/FooterInspector +Fld/Toggle extracted from NavSectionEditor — used by BOTH the standalone nav route and the page builder). `loadPageBuilder` returns `navConfig`(navigationSchema)+`navPages`+`brandName`. `PageBuilder` holds live `navConfig`, mutually-exclusive section-vs-chrome selection (`selectSection`/`selectChrome`), inspector renders HeaderInspector+MenuBuilder / FooterInspector+FooterBuilder / SectionEditor; canvas `SiteChrome` renders live navConfig + `editable` (off in Preview); inline edits debounce-autosave via `saveNavigationAction` + persist before Publish; unsaved-guard+savedot include navDirty. +1 i18n (`pbChromeHint`). Both nav surfaces (standalone routes + inline) share components/data/save — no divergence. tsc+lint+themes-compat green. **Builder-only caveat:** wrapping header in `ChromeEditWrap` (relative div) means the sticky header doesn't pin while scrolling INSIDE the builder canvas (public unaffected) — acceptable for an editor.

**▶ REDESIGN STATUS: COMPLETE.** All mockup tabs + full-screen editors + the Elementor-but-simple page builder (free elements + per-block responsive style w/ accurate preview + columns) + unified inline chrome editing shipped. Remaining = founder-call polish only (optional more free-element/column kinds; container-query for chrome too; retire standalone nav routes if desired; move Theme out of the `(editor)` tab group).

**Honest gaps shipped (intentional):** Theme route still inside `(editor)` group so its page shows the 8-tab bar with no active tab (reached via link). Settings omits unbuilt sections (editable general/privacy/integrations/password/maintenance/transfer/delete — no backend actions). Overview omits funnel/revenue/leads (not tracked).

**Full per-commit detail:** MEMORY.md ([Website CMS phases]) + CHANGELOG.md (2026-06-21 entries). Commits this group: `4e304a0`→`84a4b74` (navigation → forms).

## ▶ ACTIVE LANE (historical log): Website CMS — enterprise build-out (· 2026-06-20)

**Branch:** `main` (all work committed; working tree clean). **Contract:** `WEBSITE_CMS_PLAN.md` (+ `WEBSITE_CMS_AUDIT.md`).
Dev server runs at http://localhost:3001 — test a tenant site via `/en/site?site=<subdomain>`.

**Design law (non-negotiable):** a CURATED SECTION system, NOT a drag-and-drop/Elementor page builder. Devs pre-build beautiful responsive sections; the host drags ready-made sections in and only edits text / images / colours / variant / tone — never raw layout. Same polished feel as the Brand/Theme Studio.

**DONE & committed (this session group):**
- **Phase 0** — security/correctness: server-side `rich_text` sanitise, save UX (errors/autosave/unsaved-guard), location map render, Home-page nav lock, default-theme fallback.
- **Phase 1** — curated sections: shared `tone` + per-type `variant` on ALL 21 types, device `visibility`, date `schedule`, visual section library + schematic thumbnails, page-template gallery, saved blocks ("my blocks"). New section types amenities/pricing/video (stats/logos/map earlier). Stored on `host_websites.saved_sections` jsonb (migration `…003000`).
- **Phase 2** — header/footer/nav: menu builder (1-level dropdowns), top bar (whatsapp/phone/email), header CTA, sticky + transparent-over-hero (`components/site/StickyHeader.tsx`), footer columns, powered-by, copyright. Stored on `host_websites.navigation` jsonb (migration `…004000`).
- **Phase 3** — SEO Excellence: Yoast-style analyzer `lib/website/seoAnalyzer.ts` → red/orange/green coach (`SeoAnalysis`) on pages + blog; auto Schema.org JSON-LD `lib/site/structuredData.ts` (LodgingBusiness/rooms/reviews/Breadcrumb + BlogPosting) via `components/site/JsonLd.tsx` in `SitePageView` + blog post route; canonical URLs (`lib/site/metadata.ts`) + sitemap `lastmod`; a11y checker `lib/website/a11yAnalyzer.ts` + `A11yCard`; social share preview `SocialPreview`. Focus keyword rides existing jsonb (`seo_overrides` / blog `seo`) — no migration.
- **Polish pass** (commit `fb110cd`): builder preview now uses the real navigation; rooms/specials honor the layout picker (grid/list/carousel); structured-data hardening (absolute-URL images, no zero-star rating, string prices, slugify keyword check, wider a11y label scan); transparent-header+topbar conflict resolved; duplicate-link key fixed; newTab toggles for dropdown children + footer links. i18n 0 missing; tsc+lint clean.
- **Phase 4 FOUNDATION** (commit `4a65201`): migration `20260620005000_website_forms.sql` **APPLIED to the linked project** — `website_forms` + `website_form_submissions` (owner+admin RLS); types regenerated; tsc clean.
- **Phase 4 — Forms & Leads COMPLETE** (commits `e6de64f`→`5811859`): curated form builder (Forms tab over `website_forms`), public `form` section + service-role submit (`/api/website-form-submit` → persist + reuse `createWebsiteEnquiry` for inbox), newsletter→`host_contacts`, host responses view (filter/read/archive + per-form CSV), polish. SSOT `lib/website/forms.schema.ts`. No further migration (tables from the foundation). See the per-slice detail below + `CHANGELOG.md` 2026-06-20.

**▶ Phase 4 (Form Builder) — SLICE 1 DONE** (commit `e6de64f`): **Forms tab** live in `WebsiteTabs` → `[websiteId]/forms`. SSOT field schema `lib/website/forms.schema.ts` (`FORM_FIELD_TYPES` text/textarea/email/phone/select/checkbox/date + `formFieldSchema`/`formSettingsSchema`/`FORM_TYPES`) — shared with the slice-2 public render/submit. `loadFormsEditor` (owner-scoped; parses stored jsonb through the SSOT, counts live submissions/form). `FormsManager` master-detail island (forms list + curated builder: name/type, ordered field list add-from-catalogue/edit label·placeholder·required·dropdown-choices/reorder up-down/delete, settings submitLabel/successMessage/notifyInbox). Actions `createWebsiteFormAction`/`saveWebsiteFormAction`/`deleteWebsiteFormAction` (owner+feature gated; soft-delete; select-options sanitised client-side AND in the action). +44 `website` i18n keys (en). NO DB change. tsc+lint green.

**▶ Phase 4 (Form Builder) — SLICE 2 DONE** (commit `f22fa5e`): public render + submit. New **`form` section type** (curated, AUTO-POPULATE — references a `website_forms` row by id, resolves fields/settings live like blog/specials): added to `sections.schema` (`formProps` form_id/heading/body/variant) + union + `AUTO_POPULATE_SECTIONS`; `SiteDataByType.form` = `FormRenderData {forms: SiteFormDef[]}` in `lib/site/types.ts`; resolved via new `loadSiteForms` in `assembleSiteDataByType` (website-scoped, before the property-id guard) + fanned in `assembleSectionData` + builder `buildPreviewData`; `sectionDefaults` form starter; `SectionRenderer` case. Public **`components/site/sections/FormSection.tsx`** renders curated fields dynamically (text/textarea/email/phone/select/checkbox/date, themed `--site-*`, honeypot, success message; picks its form by props.form_id from the pool; inert when !interactive). **Submit:** `lib/website/submitWebsiteForm.ts` (validate vs field defs, honeypot, persist to `website_form_submissions`, then email-bearing + non-newsletter + notifyInbox → reuse `createWebsiteEnquiry` → store `conversation_id`) + service-role route `app/api/website-form-submit`. **Builder:** `SectionEditor` `form` case → `FormFieldsEditor` (fetches forms via new `listWebsiteFormsAction`, form picker + heading/body/variant + LiveNote); `SectionLibrary` catConvert += form; `SectionThumb` form schematic. +9 `website` i18n keys (en). NO DB change. tsc+lint green. **Newsletter→CRM = slice 3.**

**▶ Phase 4 (Form Builder) — SLICE 3 DONE** (commit `f09051c`): newsletter → CRM. `submitWebsiteForm` now branches on `formType === "newsletter"`: upserts the email into `host_contacts` (tag `newsletter` + `email_consent` via `upsertHostContact`), NO inbox conversation, respects a blocked contact, still persists the submission. Extended `upsertHostContact` with a merge-only `addTags?: string[]` (deduped, never removes) so it stays the canonical contact writer. Hoisted name/phone guess (shared by inbox + newsletter routes). NO DB change. tsc+lint green.

**▶ Phase 4 (Form Builder) — SLICE 4 DONE** (commit `87ca6d6`): responses view. New route `[websiteId]/forms/responses` (`loadFormResponses` owner-scoped loader: forms+fields + recent 1000 submissions; `ResponsesManager` island: form filter + status filter Active/Archived/All, expandable rows showing field→value via the form def, new-row dot + auto-mark-read on open, actions mark-read/archive/restore, open-in-inbox when `conversation_id`, **per-form client CSV export** [field-label columns + submitted + status, quoted]). `setSubmissionStatusAction` (owner-scoped, no feature gate — data mgmt) + `setSubmissionStatusSchema`/`SUBMISSION_STATUSES`. Nav: "Responses" link on Forms header + per-form "View N responses" in builder footer. +24 `website` i18n keys (en). NO DB change. tsc+lint green.

**▶ Phase 4 (Form Builder) — SLICE 5 (polish) DONE + PHASE 4 COMPLETE** (commit `5811859`): 3-area audit (submit/security, builder/data, UX/i18n) — verified the public render passes `interactive`/`data`, the SEO text extractor walks the new section's props, every referenced i18n key resolves. Fixes: `FormSection` guards a zero-field form (renders nothing public / hint in builder); checkbox values stored as `Yes` (was `true`) so inbox/responses/CSV read clean. All 5 slices ✅ — Forms tab + curated builder, public `form` section render + service-role submit, newsletter→CRM, responses view + CSV, polish.
**Phase 4 DEFERRED (founder to schedule):** Cloudflare Turnstile (no env keys — honeypot-only for now), newsletter double-opt-in, convert-to-booking deep-link from a submission, POPIA export/erase tooling, a default "quick contact" form auto-seeded per site.

**⛔ Phase 5 (Minutes-to-Launch / AI Site Generator) — DEFERRED INDEFINITELY (founder, 2026-06-20).** See `DECISIONS.md` ADR-022. Vilo ships **no AI website-generation ability** (no brief+engine, no generate-my-site wizard, no inline rewrite/SEO/translate assist, no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, no `website_ai_generations` log). Hosts build sites with the curated section system + templates from Phases 0–4. Do not resurrect any Phase 5 sub-task without a founder reopen of ADR-022.

**▶ IN PROGRESS — Phase 6 (Conversion & Booking).** Contract: `WEBSITE_CMS_PLAN.md` §"Phase 6". NO AI anywhere in Phase 6. **Save-point (a) COMPLETE** (3 slices below all DONE); next is save-point (b) — booking funnel.

**▶ Phase 6A — SLICE 1 DONE (trust-signals section):** new curated **`trust`** section type (`sections.schema.ts` + `TRUST_VARIANTS`) — free-form badges (icon/label/optional caption) + optional **live review score** + Pills/Cards variant. Public `components/site/sections/TrustSection.tsx` (themed, reuses shared `Stars`; renders nothing when no score + no badges). Live score reuses the reviews aggregate: `SiteDataByType.trust=ReviewsData`; `loadSitePage` reviews block fires on `reviews||trust` and sets `out.trust`; fanned in `assembleSectionData` + builder `buildPreviewData`; `loadPageBuilder` requests `trust` so the score shows in preview. Builder: `SectionEditor` trust case, `SectionLibrary` catTrust += trust, `SectionThumb` schematic, `sectionDefaults` starter. SEO extractor unchanged (walks heading/body/label/caption). +13 `website` i18n keys (en). NO DB change. tsc+lint green.

**▶ Phase 6A — SLICE 2 DONE (WhatsApp click-to-chat + announcement bar):** site-wide conversion chrome over `host_websites.settings.conversion` jsonb (extends the Phase-5 Settings tab). New `SiteConversion` type (`lib/site/types.ts`) = `{whatsapp:{enabled,number,message}, announcement:{enabled,text,linkLabel,linkHref}}`. **Public:** floating WhatsApp button (`components/site/WhatsAppButton.tsx`, server — `wa.me` link + optional pre-filled message, WhatsApp green) + dismissible announcement bar (`components/site/AnnouncementBar.tsx`, client — themed strip above header, optional CTA link, localStorage dismissal keyed by message text; always-show/never-persist in preview). Both injected in `SiteChrome` (announcement above the top bar, button before close) + threaded via `SitePageView` + both `site/blog` routes; `conversion` prop defaults `{}`. **Plumbing:** `websiteSettingsSchema` + `saveWebsiteSettingsAction` persist a `conversion` block (CTA href sanitised http(s)/internal); `SiteContext.conversion` resolved in `loadSiteContext` (snapshot→live `settings.conversion`); FROZEN into `PublishSnapshot` via `buildWebsiteSnapshot` (added `settings` to its select — editing conversion now marks the site dirty for republish). **Builder:** two new Settings cards (WhatsApp/Announcement) in `SettingsForm` (toggles+fields; seeds WhatsApp number from brand contact phone on first enable). +18 `website` en i18n keys. NO DB change. tsc+lint green.

**▶ Phase 6A — SLICE 3 DONE (pop-ups) — SAVE-POINT (a) COMPLETE:** site-wide pop-up modal over `settings.conversion.popup` (same frozen-snapshot pattern as slice 2). `SiteConversion.popup` = `{enabled, heading, body, trigger:delay|scroll|exit, delaySeconds, scrollPercent, frequency:once|daily|always, ctaLabel, ctaHref, formId}`. **Public:** `components/site/SitePopup.tsx` (client) — themed modal on a trigger rule (delay/scroll-depth/exit-intent), freq cap via localStorage keyed by content; optional **embedded `website_forms` form** (compact `PopupForm`, posts to existing `/api/website-form-submit` → newsletter→contacts) OR a CTA link; opens-immediately/never-persists/inert-form in preview. Injected in `SiteChrome` (+ `SitePageView` + blog routes). **Plumbing:** `websiteSettingsSchema` + `saveWebsiteSettingsAction` persist a `popup` block (shared `cleanHref`); `SiteContext.popupForm` resolved live in `loadSiteContext` by `popup.formId` via new shared `mapFormRow` SSOT (refactored out of `loadSiteForms`); pop-up rides the already-frozen `conversion` snapshot (dirty-marks on edit). **Builder:** Pop-up card in `SettingsForm` (toggle/heading/body/trigger+conditional delay·scroll/frequency/form picker via `listWebsiteFormsAction`/CTA). +27 `website` en i18n keys. NO DB change. tsc+lint green.

**▶ Phase 6 — SAVE-POINT (b) DONE (booking funnel sections):** three curated auto-populate section types wired to the LIVE engine with **server-recalculated** pricing (client never trusted). **`booking_search`** (client `BookingSearchSection`) date+guest search → POST `/api/website-quote` → live availability + server-recomputed whole-stay price (via canonical `computeStayPricing`) → deep-link `/property/[slug]/book?from&to&guests`; rooms-only props show availability + "choose room at checkout". **`availability_calendar`** (client) 1–2-month grid reading live blocked dates from POST `/api/website-availability`; open days deep-link with date pre-filled. **`rate_table`** (server) live nightly rates across visible rooms (display-only). **Server SSOT `lib/website/bookingFunnel.ts`** `quoteWebsiteStay`/`websiteAvailability` (+Zod) — service-role admin client gated by an anti-tamper **membership check** (property must be a *visible* `website_properties` member of the website); availability via `listing_is_available_whole`/`blocked_dates`; never throws. Route handlers `app/api/website-quote` + `app/api/website-availability` (mirror `website-form-submit`). `loadSitePage`: `loadBookableProperties`+`loadRateTable` (resolve before the property-id guard) fanned via `assembleSiteDataByType`/`assembleSectionData`. Builder: `SiteDataByType` (`BookingFunnelData`×2 + `RateTableData`), schema/union/AUTO_POPULATE (+3), renderer cases, `sectionDefaults`, `SectionEditor` cases + shared `FunnelPropertyPicker` (`listWebsiteBookablePropertiesAction`), `SectionLibrary` "Booking" group, `SectionThumb` schematics, `SectionBuilder` preview mapper. +16 `website` en i18n keys. NO DB change. tsc+lint green; themes-compat 🎉.

**▶ Phase 6 — SAVE-POINT (c) DONE (on-site checkout) — PHASE 6 COMPLETE.** Full booking checkout on the host's OWN tenant domain (search→select→details→pay→thank-you), reusing the existing engine; **server-recalculated** pricing (client never trusted on money). **Shared core `lib/bookings/createBooking.ts` `createBookingCore(input, actor, ctx)`** extracted verbatim from `createBookingAction` (validate→`priceStay`→avail RPCs→`persistBookingAndPay`); `createBookingAction` now a thin auth wrapper (behaviour preserved). **Session-less surface `lib/website/siteCheckout.ts`**: `siteBookingQuote` (live price+avail via `computeStayPricing`) + `createSiteBooking` (passwordless guest via `findOrCreateLeadIdentity` → core), both membership-gated via exported `resolveSiteProperty`, admin client. Routes `/api/site-booking-quote` + `/api/site-booking`. **Pages** `app/[locale]/site/book/page.tsx` (membership-gated loader: property+rooms+payment rails [Paystack/EFT]+cancellation note) + `SiteCheckoutForm.tsx` (client, `--site-*`: dates/whole-or-rooms/party/contact/payment/policy + live total) + `book/thank-you/page.tsx` (card confirm via existing `confirmHostCardPaymentByReference`; EFT awaiting-transfer + bank details; anti-tamper). **Links repointed on-site** via new `siteBookHref(ctx,…)` + `siteParam→ctx.bookBasePath` threading (loadSiteContext/SitePageView/site routes). **Middleware fix:** tenant-host `/api`+functional trees now pass through (tagged `x-vilo-site-host`) instead of being rewritten into `/site/*` (also fixes the existing website-* endpoints for real tenant domains; app routing unchanged, host tests 10/10). NO DB change. tsc+lint green; themes-compat 🎉; host tests 10/10. **Follow-ups DONE:** (1) the header "Book now" CTA now defaults to the on-site `/book` checkout (guarded by `propertyIds>0`; host nav CTA still overrides) — booking reachable via header button + funnel sections + room Book buttons; (2) **add-ons + coupons now work on the on-site checkout** — split `lib/bookings/createBooking.ts` into `priceBooking` (price-only, `skipAvailability`/`couponSoft`) + `createBookingCore` (price→persist→pay) so the live quote and the charge share ONE pricing path; `siteBookingQuote` prices via `priceBooking` (returns `couponApplied`); `SiteCheckoutForm` gained an "Add extras" section (selection-aware, required-included, qty per pricing model) + a coupon field with applied indicator; eligible add-ons loaded in the checkout page loader. **Deferred (founder):** Turnstile/bot-hardening on checkout; OPS `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN`+wildcard DNS to run on real tenant domains (W5 todo; test via app-domain `?site=` until then); the vestigial Aria `/checkout` + `/thank-you` placeholder pages (superseded by the `/book` route). **PHASE 6 (Conversion & Booking) COMPLETE — a+b+c all shipped.** NO AI anywhere in Phase 6.

**▶ Phase 7 (Blog Completion & Media) STARTED — save-point (a) DONE.** Discovery: most of (a) already existed (Tiptap `RichTextEditor`, `body_html` storage, sanitised render allowing `<img src alt>`, inline image upload; scheduled-publish cron `20260619006000` + `/api/blog-publish` already built; index/related/author/featured all done). **(a) gap closed:** insert an image from the **media library** (reuse an uploaded asset + its alt) — `RichTextEditor` optional `onPickFromLibrary()` + "Choose from library" button (inserts `src`+`alt`); `MediaLibrary` optional `onSelectItem(item)` (returns url+alt; `onSelect` now optional, other callers unchanged); blog `PostEditor` wires a promise-based picker opening the `MediaLibrary` modal. NO DB change. tsc+lint green. **Save-point (b) DONE — blog tags.** Migration `20260621002000_website_blog_tags.sql` (`website_blog_tags` + `website_blog_post_tags` join, owner+admin RLS; **pushed** + types regenerated). Tags created inline from the post editor: `saveBlogPostSchema.tags:string[]` → `saveBlogPostAction` find-or-creates by slug + replaces the join; `loadBlogPost` returns post `tags` + site `allTags`; `PostEditor` chip-style `TagField` (+3 i18n keys). Public: `loadSiteBlogPost` returns tags (rendered as `#tag` chips on the detail linking to the archive); `loadSiteBlogByTag` + new route `app/[locale]/site/blog/tag/[tagSlug]/page.tsx`. (RSS `/feed.xml` + scheduled-publish cron already existed.) NO DB change beyond the tags migration. tsc+lint green. **Save-point (c) DONE — PHASE 7 COMPLETE.** Image pipeline + lightbox + media + perf score; NO DB change; tsc+lint green. **(1) Supabase image transforms + responsive delivery site-wide:** `lib/site/image.ts` `siteImageUrl` (public `website-assets` object URL → `/render/image/...?width=&quality=` variant, WebP/AVIF via Accept header) + `siteImageSrcSet`; no-op passthrough for non-project URLs + SVGs. `components/site/SiteImg.tsx` = the ONE public `<img>` (responsive srcset/sizes, lazy by default, eager+`fetchpriority=high` when `priority`, graceful non-transformable fallback) — pure presentational (no directive → renders in server sections AND the client lightbox; chosen OVER next/image so it works on tenant custom domains with no `/_next/image` dep or Vercel optimizer cost). Converted EVERY public image: gallery/host-bio/rooms-preview/blog-preview/logos/specials-preview, hero CSS backgrounds (fixed-width transform), chrome logo, blog index/tag-archive/post-detail covers+author avatar+related. **Verified live:** a 2.5 MB PNG → 56 KB WebP @w480 / 133 KB @w1280 (transforms ARE enabled on the linked project — probed the render endpoint). **(2) Lightbox:** `components/site/GalleryLightbox.tsx` (client) — grid (grid/list/carousel) + swipeable fullscreen overlay (prev/next, Arrow/Esc keys, touch-swipe, counter, caption, scroll-lock); `GallerySection` delegates to it. **(3) Fresh editor uploads → media library:** `RichTextEditor.onImageUpload` now returns `{url,alt}`; `PostEditor.uploadBodyImage` switched to the media path (`createWebsiteMediaUploadUrl`+`registerWebsiteMediaAction`) — prompts alt, captures intrinsic dims, registers into `website_media` (reusable + alt/CLS-ready). **(4) Perf score:** `lib/website/perfAnalyzer.ts` pure `analyzeSitePerformance` over the media library (responsive ✓ always + alt coverage + known-dimensions/CLS → 0–100 + graded checks, mirrors seo/a11y coach); `loadOverviewData` counts `website_media`, Overview renders an "Image performance" card. +14 `website` en i18n keys (`imageAltPrompt` + `perf*`). **Deferred (founder):** real field CWV (RUM beacon+aggregation — current score is lab/readiness); media replace-in-place + folders; optimising user-inserted `<img>` inside sanitised blog `body_html`. NO AI.

**▶ NEW LANE — Website CMS PREMIUM REDESIGN (founder pivot, 2026-06-21).** Match approved mockups pixel-perfect for Overview/Pages/Blog/Navigation/Forms + their full-screen editors, + a SIMPLE in-page builder (palette·canvas·inspector, "Classic" direction; device desktop/tablet/mobile; per-block style overrides — ADDITIVE to the existing 26-section jsonb model, NOT an element tree). All mockup assets received; app `brand-*` tokens already = mockup emerald palette + 3 fonts already loaded. Decisions (AskUserQuestion): builder = section-blocks + light free elements (Columns/Heading/Text/Image/Button/Spacer/Divider) + per-viewport style; Overview = portfolio+analytics; canonical tab set = Overview·Pages·Blog·Navigation·Forms·Domain·SEO·Settings (NO Funnels). Navigation+Forms backends already exist (Phase 2/4) → UI redesigns. **Phasing (each own save-point):** (0)✅ foundation → (1) Blog tab → (2) Blog editor → (3) Forms tab → (4) Form editor → (5) Navigation tab → (6) Header/Menu/Footer editors → (7) Overview → (8) Pages tab → (9) page-builder shell → (10) per-block responsive style + free blocks. **TO RECONCILE while building:** Theme/Brand/Rooms tabs (app has 11 LIVE_TABS, mockup 8 — fold into Settings/editors?); editors must go FULL-SCREEN (break out of `dashboard/layout.tsx` shell). **▶ PHASE 0 DONE:** `scripts/scope-css.mjs` (brace-aware selector-scoper + keyframe-namespacer) generated `app/[locale]/dashboard/website/cms.css` (scoped `.vilo-cms`) + `builder.css` (scoped `.vilo-builder`) from the mockup stylesheets; both imported via new `website/layout.tsx` (CSS-only). INERT until a screen adds the wrapper class → zero visual change; tsc+lint green. **▶ PHASE 1 (Blog tab) DONE.** `blog/BlogManager.tsx` rebuilt to `Blog Manager.html`: `.vilo-cms` wrapper, header (title+count+"N published"), `.eseg` filter (All/Published/Drafts/Scheduled), New-post button → 6-template `.modal` (each seeds a blank draft via `createBlogPostAction` → opens editor; template seeding deferred), `.card` posts table (cover thumb+author+slug · category `.tag` · status `.tag` · published date · Edit + ⋯ menu w/ Feature/Delete). Categories+authors moved into a "Categories & authors" `.modal` (reuses existing ItemListEditor + save actions) so nothing's stranded. `loadBlogEditor` now loads `coverPath`+`authorName` (per-post reads NOT tracked → column omitted, not faked). `blog/page.tsx` full-width, BlogManager owns its header. **New shared `cms-extra.css`** (hand-authored, scoped `.vilo-cms`: `.ptr/.pthumb/.eseg/.tpl/.modal/.stat` — the page-level classes the mockups keep inline; reused by Forms/Pages managers) imported in `website/layout.tsx`. +16 en i18n keys. Table `.card` has NO overflow-hidden (so the ⋯ menu escapes) + header row rounded 16px top. tsc+lint green. **Surrounding header/tab-bar chrome UNCHANGED this phase** (shell restyle + Theme/Brand/Rooms re-home = a later shell phase with Overview). **▶ PHASE 2 (Blog post editor) DONE — first FULL-SCREEN editor.** Established the full-screen editor route pattern OUTSIDE `/dashboard` (so editors escape the dashboard shell): **`app/[locale]/website-editor/`** = root `layout.tsx` (auth getUser→redirect + imports `builder.css`+`blog-editor.css`, no chrome) → `[websiteId]/layout.tsx` (owner+`website_builder` gate, reuses `loadWebsiteEditorData`+`WebsiteLocked`) → `[websiteId]/blog/[postId]/{page,loadBlogPost,PostEditor}.tsx`. **PostEditor rebuilt** to `Blog Post Editor.html`: `.vilo-builder` full-screen (`.etop` back·pill·status·wordcount·Preview·Publish/Update/Schedule + `.ebody`: centered `.post-doc` [cover-replace · category eyebrow · auto-grow title+standfirst · author meta · Tiptap body] + right `.epanel` rail [Status choice+schedule+feature · Organise category/tags/author · Featured image · Link&SEO live SERP preview] + Preview mode hides chrome). ALL existing wiring preserved (saveBlogPostAction, delete, media-library cover[mode]+body upload w/ alt, tags). New `website-editor/blog-editor.css` (scoped `.vilo-builder`: document + SERP + preview + `.tag` pills [builder.css lacks them] + body typography targeting Tiptap `.ProseMirror`). `RichTextEditor` toolbar got a `.rte-toolbar` class (sticky/hidden-in-preview). **BlogManager links repointed to `/website-editor/...`; OLD `(editor)/blog/[postId]` route DELETED** (had to also `rm -rf .next/types/.../[postId]` stale generated type for tsc). +13 i18n keys. tsc+lint green. **Deviations to refine:** standfirst serif falls back to Georgia (Spectral not bundled); body toolbar is RichTextEditor's own bar (not a separate top `.ftbar`); verified by tsc+lint, NOT a live render. **NEXT = Phase 3 (Forms tab, `Forms Manager.html`):** rebuild `[websiteId]/(editor)/forms/page.tsx` to the mockup (stats band [Submissions this month/Live forms/Avg completion] + filter eseg + New-form 6-template modal + forms table Form/Type/Status/Submissions·30d/Actions) wrapped in `.vilo-cms`, reusing `cms-extra.css` (`.stat` tiles already added), wired to existing `website_forms`/FormsManager data + actions. (Forms backend already exists from Phase 4.)

**▶ DOMAIN TAB DONE (out of strict order — founder sent Domain/SEO/Settings mockups + "continue"; built the cleanest self-contained one).** `domain/DomainManager.tsx` rebuilt to `Domain Manager.html` (.vilo-cms): Primary-domain card (subdomain hero w/ Live+SSL tags + inline edit), Connect-custom-domain card (input+Connect gated on `configured`; `.dns` records table w/ copy; SSL status), Forwarding&HTTPS card (Force-HTTPS always-on tag + apex/www canonical `.eseg`). Reuses ALL existing domain actions + loadDomainData (fully wired backend, non-breaking). `domain/page.tsx` full-width. **Added shared SETTINGS PRIMITIVES to `cms-extra.css`** (scoped .vilo-cms): `.wrap-set/.sblock/.sblock-h/.setrow(.col/.lbl/.ctl)/.field(.mono/textarea/select/.field-w)/.lblrow/.sw`(40px) + domain `.domhero/.dns` — **SEO + Settings tabs REUSE these**. +24 dom i18n keys. tsc+lint green. **ALL TAB MOCKUPS NOW IN HAND** (Domain/SEO/Settings received). **Remaining redesign work:** SEO tab (`SEO Manager.html`: search-appearance meta+google preview, social OG, per-page SEO table reading website_pages.seo_overrides, indexing/sitemap/robots/GSC — site-level meta storage TBD) · Settings tab (`Website Settings.html`: General name/tagline/lang/tz/currency, Branding favicon+BrandStudio link, Privacy cookie/consent [Phase 10, partly unbuilt], Access password/maintenance [unbuilt], Integrations GA4/MetaPixel/custom-head [Phase 10 unbuilt], Danger publish/transfer/delete — wire what exists, omit/disable unbuilt) · Forms tab+editor (coupled) · Nav tab+editors · Overview+shell+tab-reconcile · Pages tab · page-builder · per-block style. **▶ SEO TAB DONE.** `seo/SeoForm.tsx` rebuilt to `SEO Manager.html` (.vilo-cms): Search appearance (meta title+desc w/ `.cc` char counters + `.gprev` Google preview), Social (`.imgpick` share image via MediaLibrary + `.ogprev` OG card — reuses meta title/desc, no separate social fields = deferred storage), **Page-by-page SEO** `.seorow` table (REAL per-page data: `seo/page.tsx` loads website_pages.seo_overrides → hasTitle/hasDescription → Good/Fair/Missing `.score`, links to page builder), Indexing (allow-search-engines `.sw`, sitemap on/off `.sw`+tag, GSC input). Reuses `saveSeoAction` (non-breaking). Added SEO styles to cms-extra.css (`.cc/.gprev/.ogprev/.imgpick`[.vilo-cms]/`.seorow/.score/.checkpill`). +18 i18n keys. tsc+lint green. **NEXT = Settings tab** (`Website Settings.html`): General (name/tagline/lang/tz/currency — name/tagline wired via brand; lang/tz/currency = host_websites.settings, check storage), Branding (favicon + Brand Studio link), Privacy (cookie/consent = Phase 10 UNBUILT → omit or disabled-with-note), Access (password/maintenance UNBUILT → omit/disabled; indexing→SEO link), Integrations (GA4/MetaPixel/custom-head = Phase 10 UNBUILT → omit/disabled), Danger (publish/unpublish via PublishBar logic, transfer UNBUILT, delete via deleteWebsiteAction if exists). **Wire what exists, omit/clearly-disable unbuilt — NO fake toggles.** Then Forms(tab+editor)·Nav(tab+editors)·Overview(+shell/tab-reconcile)·Pages·page-builder·per-block style.

**▶ THEME & BRAND WIRING (founder mid-phase, 2026-06-21) DONE.** Discovery: the theme-activation engine **already existed** (parallel theme lane on `main`): `site_themes` catalogue rows carry a visual `base` **+** `page_templates` (full multi-page section blueprints w/ auto-populate sections); `applyThemeAction` captures a restore point then rebuilds pages from the blueprint + copies `base`→`host_websites.theme` (reversible; restores prior edits on re-switch); `createWebsiteAction` auto-applies the **default** theme on create; Brand Studio (`saveBrandStudioAction`) restyles everything; the `?theme=<slug>` preview override is plumbed through `SitePageView`→`loadSiteContext`. Migrations all already applied remotely. **Gaps closed this session:** (A) **all theme previews open in a new tab** (`/site?site=<sub>&preview=1&theme=<slug>`) — replaced the gallery iframe modal with a real new-tab preview + a small reversible `ThemeActivateModal` (commit `22d376b`); (B) **new flagship default theme "Aria"** — migration `20260621000000_theme_aria_default.sql` (data-only, **pushed**): modern editorial-luxe base (paper `#F6F4EF`/ink/eucalyptus `#2F5D4F`/`elegant`/`lg`) + 7-page blueprint (home/about/rooms/contact/blog/checkout/thank-you, 23 sections, home folds in the new `trust` section), set as **sole default** (demotes warm/coastal); (C) verified `scripts/verify-theme-aria.mjs` 22/22 green on live DB. **(D) compatibility** — `scripts/verify-themes-compat.mjs` runs ALL active themes' `page_templates` through the real `sections.schema` (`parseSectionsLoose`, via Node TS type-stripping): aria/warm/coastal all validate with **0 sections dropped**; every type used exists in `SECTION_TYPES`; Phase-4 Forms flow through every theme via each Contact page's `contact_form`→inbox. Migration `20260621001000_themes_add_trust.sql` (pushed, idempotent) adds the `trust` section to warm+coastal home too (Aria already had it). **Follow-up (optional):** load Cormorant/Inter web fonts site-wide so `elegant` renders as designed (currently falls back to Georgia/system).

**Conventions/gotchas:** verify with `cd apps/web && pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` + `pnpm next lint --file …` (NOT `pnpm build` — the dev server holds `.next`). **Commit subject MUST start lowercase after the type** (commitlint subject-case rejects "feat(x): SEO …"/"Yoast …" → start with a verb like "add"). Stage bracketed paths with `GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS=1`. Pre-commit hook runs prettier (re-reads files after). End commits with the `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8` trailer. Migration flow: write file → `echo y | supabase db push --linked` → `supabase gen types typescript --linked > packages/types/database.types.ts 2>/tmp/e.log` (NEVER pipe stderr into the types file). **Founder rule: polish/perfect each phase before moving to the next** (run a 3-area audit + fix).

> - **S5b website render DONE 2026-06-19** (code-only, no migration): new
>   `components/site/sections/SpecialsPreview.tsx` (themed `--site-*` card grid: hero/badge/
>   savings-% chip, strike-through wasPrice, scarcity ≤5, Book CTA → `bookHref`) + registered the
>   `specials_preview` case in `SectionRenderer`; `assembleSiteDataByType` now resolves
>   `specials_preview` via new `loadSpecialsPreview(sb,ctx)` — **business-scoped** (the special's own
>   `show_on_website` flag governs, so resolved BEFORE the propertyIds early-return; ignores channel
>   membership), mirrors the directory JS guards (live/bookable/not-past/not-sold-out), hero falls back
>   to the property's first photo, featured-first then sort_order, `bookHref` = `specialBookHref` →
>   `/special/[slug]/book?via=website`; `assembleSectionData` fans it to section ids. Builder: added
>   `specials_preview` to SectionLibrary `GROUPS` (catShowcase, Tag icon — now pickable) + a
>   SectionEditor case (heading/layout/max/ctaLabel + LiveNote). +4 en.json keys
>   (`sectionType_/sectionDesc_specials_preview`, `fldSpecialsCtaLabel`, `liveSpecials`). Specials
>   render LIVE (not via the publish snapshot, like blog). type-check+lint+build green.
> - **S6b view tracking + conversion** — `special_view`/`special_book_click` via `/api/site-track`
>   beacon + track-listing-view pattern on the platform detail page; aggregate per special in
>   `lib/website/analytics.ts`; add views + view→booking conversion to the S6a panel.
> - **S7a feature gate DONE 2026-06-19** (code + seed migration, no schema change): new
>   SSOT `lib/specials/gate.ts` — `SPECIALS_FEATURE_KEY='specials'` + `canUseSpecials(hostId)`
>   wires the canonical `check_feature_permission` RPC (via shared `hostHasFeature`) but
>   short-circuits to `true` behind a `PRE_MVP_OPEN` flag (AGENT_RULES §3.4 — hosts have no
>   subscriptions row yet, so the fail-closed RPC would lock everyone out; flip the flag at
>   launch, no other code change). **Action layer:** `createSpecialAction` + `updateSpecialAction`
>   now call `canUseSpecials(host.hostId)` (replaced the local always-true stub). **UI layer:**
>   `dashboard/specials/page.tsx` resolves the gate and renders a "not on your plan yet" card
>   when unentitled (never shows pre-MVP). Seed migration `20260619002000_specials_feature_gate.sql`
>   inserts `specials`=true for free/basic/pro/business (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING). Added
>   `{key:'specials',label:'Specials',scope:'toggle'}` to `CANONICAL_PRODUCT_FEATURES` so the admin
>   product editor can configure it. Public special-booking flow deliberately NOT gated (the guest
>   isn't the entitled party; the host's entitlement is checked at create/publish). build+lint green.
> - **S7b help article DONE 2026-06-19** — DB-backed help migration
>   `20260619003000_help_specials.sql` inserts the host-audience, published
>   `specials` article ("Creating and selling Specials") under the `listings`
>   category (idempotent on slug; category falls back to the first existing one).
>   Covers what a Special is, building one (fixed/flexible dates, go-live/book-by/
>   quantity), the two pricing modes (flat package vs per-night) + savings badge,
>   visibility channels (directory + website section), redeem/release on booking,
>   and the per-special report. SQL-only — no schema change, no type regen, no code.
> - **S7c-1 i18n: dashboard CRUD DONE 2026-06-19** — new `specials` namespace in
>   `messages/en.json` (~150 keys); every hardcoded string in the S1 list
>   (`page.tsx` server `generateMetadata`+`getTranslations`, async hero;
>   `SpecialsList.tsx` client `useTranslations`, `STATUS_STYLE`→`STATUS_CLS`+i18n
>   labels, plural `countLabel`, `t` threaded to card/chips) + editor
>   (`SpecialEditor.tsx` all sections/fields/options/save-bar, category chips via
>   `t(\`category_${key}\`)`, link-only note via `t.rich`; `fields.tsx`
>   TagInput/HeroImageField; `EmptyProperties`) + new/edit `generateMetadata`. No
>   string values changed; `lib/specials/categories.ts` English labels kept as the
>   `specialCategoryLabel` fallback (public directory i18n = S7c-2). Code-only, no
>   migration. tsc+lint+build green.
> - **S7c-2 i18n: public DONE 2026-06-19** — new public keys in the `specials`
>   namespace; every hardcoded string wired through `t()` across the `/specials`
>   directory (`page.tsx` generateMetadata + getTranslations, type/category
>   chips, plural deal count, pagination), `SpecialCard` (now async server
>   component), the shared `/special/[slug]` detail (dates/included/cancellation/
>   savings/CTA/sold-out), and `/special/[slug]/book` (+ `SpecialBookingForm`
>   client island: validation/dates/guests/extras/details/summary/payment/ack).
>   Curated category keys translate; unknown keys fall back to
>   `specialCategoryLabel`. tsc+lint+build green. (commit `44e8e06`)
> - **Founder redesigns (2026-06-19, same session, committed):**
>   (a) **Specials Manager** rebuilt to `Specials Manager.html` — light header +
>   intro, 4-tile stat band (Live/Scheduled/Drafts/Top deal via a derived
>   bucket), search + status filter chips + sort + card⇄table view toggle,
>   savings-ribbon cards + ghost create card, all row actions preserved
>   (`52e4b03`). (b) **Special editor** rebuilt to `Special Editor.html` —
>   identity bar + health progress ring + 8-section rail (more than the
>   mockup's 5: our deal carries property/room/add-ons/categories/policy) +
>   single active panel + footer nav + docked guest preview; same form
>   state/actions (`76cada3`). (c) **Public surfacing** — site header "Deals"
>   nav → `/specials`; property page gains a "Specials" tab/section via
>   `loadPropertySpecials` (card grid → `/special/[slug]`) (`08a655e`).
> - **Deals public-facing pass DONE 2026-06-19** (founder, same session): split
>   terminology — **public/guest = "Deals", host/back-end = "Specials"**.
>   (a) **`/special/[slug]` rebuilt listing-style** (mirrors the room view):
>   breadcrumb → property, header (badge/category chips + "Part of {property}" +
>   Share button), `PhotoGallery` (room-scoped photos if room-targeted, else
>   property; hero first), 4-tile stats grid (Guests/Nights/Save/Book by),
>   sectioned body (About · Included · Dates · property `AmenitiesList` ·
>   Cancellation · part-of-property card · report), sticky price/Book panel.
>   New `ShareSpecialButton`. (b) Manager row-menu gains **Copy share link** +
>   menu now opens **upward** (was clipped by card `overflow-hidden`).
>   (c) **Public routes renamed** `/specials→/deals`, `/special/[slug]→/deal/[slug]`
>   (+`/book`); all card/book/share/nav/`bookHref` links + directory `BASE_PATH`
>   updated (host routes stay `/dashboard/specials`). (d) **Public copy → "Deals"**
>   (en.json values only; host strings keep "Specials"). Build+lint green. Touched
>   shared files (SiteHeader, loadSitePage, property page) — staged explicit paths.
> - **S7c-3 i18n: report panel DONE 2026-06-19** (commit `c6c3098`): every string
>   in `dashboard/specials/[id]/page.tsx` wired through new `rp*` keys (KPIs,
>   sell-through, funnel, traffic/conversion, recent bookings, footnote, header)
>   + `rpStat_*` booking-status labels (humanise fallback); `generateMetadata`
>   replaces the static title. **Website-section note:** the builder
>   `SectionEditor`/`SectionLibrary` case was already i18n'd in S5b; the public
>   `components/site/sections/SpecialsPreview.tsx` follows the site-section
>   convention (hardcoded English like all 18 siblings — tenant hosts don't run
>   next-intl), so nothing to do there. Code-only.
> - **Public deal page redesign DONE 2026-06-19** (founder add-on; commits
>   `3164d97` redesign + `025ac7a` rooms) — `/deal/[slug]` rebuilt to
>   `C:\Users\Wollie\Downloads\Special Detail.html`, guest-facing: gallery-mosaic
>   hero (reuses property `PhotoGallery`) + savings ribbon, sticky scrollspy
>   subnav (new `_components/DealSubnav.tsx`), at-a-glance tiles + "Vilo charges
>   hosts no fee" reassurance, "what you get" offer rows (price/savings/included),
>   dates tiles, **"Rooms in this deal"** (single targeted room, or every active
>   property_room for a whole-property deal — facts-only cards, no per-room price),
>   amenities, "good to know" (cancellation + part-of-property + report), sticky
>   deal-summary panel. All i18n via new `dd*` keys. build+lint green.
> - **FIN (NEXT, not done)** — full `pnpm build`+`pnpm lint` green, CHANGELOG,
>   fast-forward `main` + push. The S0–S7 build is COMPLETE on `agent-specials`;
>   `main` is behind. Per LANE.md `main` is owned outside the specials lane —
>   founder/head-dev does the FF + push. No migrations pending from the last commits.
> Fresh session per sub-task; stage explicit paths only; build before each commit.

**Prior focus (paused):** **Website CMS pivot + `listings → properties` rename (Property + Channels model).**

> **RESUME ANCHOR (multi-session project).** Branch: `feat/website-property-restructure`.
> Plan: `~/.claude/plans/ok-it-has-come-spicy-snail.md`. Rename checklist + progress log:
> `RENAME_LISTINGS_TO_PROPERTIES.md` (repo root). To continue in a fresh session: read

>
> **Sequence:** Phase 0 = full `listings→properties` rename in 5 green checkpoints
> (R0 inventory ✓ → R1 leaf tables → R2 core tables → R3 `listing_id→property_id` cols →
> R4 routes+i18n). THEN the website build (plan §1+): Property+Channels, per-business
> `host_websites` CMS, subdomains + custom domains, sidebar/IA restructure, product gating.
> Ledger/booking core is NOT touched. Each phase: migration → `db push --linked` → gen types
> → code sweep → `pnpm build`+`pnpm lint`+query-sweep → commit → (optionally start fresh session).
>
> **Status:** R0 done (inventory); R1 done (8 leaf tables, commit `ca78d20`); R2 done
> (7 core tables `listings→properties` + core children; migration
> `20260617000200_rename_r2_core_tables.sql`; 30 fns recreated; 112 code files + 4

> `dashboard/listings`→`dashboard/properties`, `admin/listings`→`admin/properties` +
> `[listingId]`→`[propertyId]`, iCal `[listing_id]`→`[property_id]`) with every path-string

> (routes) + i18n commit. **Deferred to website §5:** the ~50 *hardcoded* "Listing" page
> headings/labels (extract to i18n during the IA pass, don't hardcoded-swap now).
> **The R0–R4 physical rename is COMPLETE.** **Website build STARTED** (plan §8 — 15
> phases). **W1 (Data foundation) DONE** — migration `20260617000500_website_foundation.sql`
> created 7 additive tables (`host_websites`, `website_pages`, `website_properties`,
> `website_rooms`, `website_blog_categories`, `website_blog_posts`, INSERT-only
> `website_domain_events`) + owner/admin RLS + `update_updated_at` triggers + public
> `website-assets` bucket & host-scoped object policies + `plan_features` seed (4 new
> keys × 4 plans, open pre-MVP). Added the 4 keys to `lib/products/features.ts` and the
> shared Zod section union at `apps/web/lib/website/sections.schema.ts` (co-located, NOT
> `packages/schemas`, to avoid a pnpm-install risk — deviation noted). Pushed; types
> regenerated; build+lint+type-check green; `scripts/verify-website-foundation.mjs` 🎉.
> **Naming note:** channel table is `website_properties(property_id)` (authored post-rename).
> **W2 (Sidebar IA, plan §5) DONE** (commit `1770a98`) — config-only re-author of
> `dashboard/_components/Sidebar.tsx` into 5 groups: always-open daily driver
> (Overview/Calendar/Bookings/Inbox/Guests) + collapsible Properties/Channels/Finances/
> Insights. New gated **Website** row (NEW badge) → `/dashboard/website` + a `ComingSoon`
> placeholder page (replaced in W6). Folded rows removed (Rooms/Seasonal/Listing-extras/
> Add-ons/per-property Policies — already editor tabs); account Policies+Staff kept in
> footer; "Channels"→"OTA channels"; Affiliates under Insights. Build+lint+type-check green.
> **Deferred:** (a) business/website switcher → W6 (first consumer is the per-business site;
> a `vilo_active_business` cookie now would be a no-op — views are all-businesses, Ledger/
> Guest-record use `?business=`); (b) Policies/Staff as Settings tabs (route move); (c) the
> ~50 hardcoded "Listing" headings → i18n sweep.
> **W3 (shared section components + renderer, plan §2/§8.3) DONE** (commit `12873de`):
> the ONE presentational component set (preview === public) — `lib/site/themes.ts`
> (5 presets → `--site-*` vars via `buildSiteVars`), `components/site/SiteThemeRoot`
> (scopes the vars), `SiteChrome` (header/nav/footer + Book CTA), `lib/site/types.ts`
> (auto-populate `SiteData` shapes + `dataFor`), 13 `components/site/sections/*` +
> `_shared`, and `SectionRenderer` (switch(type), passes live `data` to auto sections +
> an `asset` path→URL resolver to hero/host_bio). Pure presentational, no fetching, read
> `--site-*` only. Temp harness at `dashboard/website/preview` (sample data + preset
> switcher; sample sections validated through W1 `sectionsSchema`). Build+lint+type-check
> green. **W4 (public site routes + loadSitePage, plan §8.4) DONE** (commit `8f66b7f`):
> `lib/site/loadSitePage.ts` (service-role; `resolveSiteRef` ?site/host-header,
> `loadSiteContext` brand/theme/nav + published-only-unless-preview, `loadSitePage`
> page-by-path + published/draft sections + auto-populate data for gallery/rooms/location/
> reviews/blog, `loadSiteBlogPost`) + routes under **`app/[locale]/site/*`** (home,
> `[...slug]`, `blog/[postSlug]`, host-aware `sitemap.xml`+`robots.txt`, `not-found`;
> all force-dynamic) + `SitePageView` (shared frame + public-bucket asset resolver).
> Testable via `/<locale>/site?site=<sub>`. `scripts/verify-website-site-loader.mjs` 🎉.
> **KEY DEVIATION:** mounted under `[locale]/site/` NOT a `(site)` root group — `_`-prefixed
> folders (`__site`) are non-routable in Next, and a 2nd route-group root layout can't
> coexist with the non-grouped `[locale]` root. Booking CTAs deep-link the engine. Chrome
> reads live columns (published_snapshot fast-path → W10).
> **W5 (middleware host routing, plan §8.5/§3) DONE** (commit `de12cdf`):
> `lib/site/host.ts` pure classifier (`classifyHost` app vs {site,ref}, `RESERVED_SUBDOMAINS`,
> `siteRewritePath`, `isSeoFile`) — FAIL-SAFE (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN` ⇒ all app, opt-in
> by env). `middleware.ts`: classifier FIRST; tenant host → rewrite `/<defaultLocale>/site<path>`
> + `x-vilo-site-host`, NO next-intl/NO session (no cookies on tenant hosts); app hosts UNCHANGED;
> sitemap.xml/robots.txt added to matcher. `host.test.ts` 10 tests (the mandated app-routing-
> unchanged guard) — vitest 49/49 green. `ENV_VARS.md` + new `WEBSITE_HOSTING.md` (DNS/Vercel ops,
> reserved subs, `?site=` pre-DNS testing). **OPS TODO (founder):** set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN=
> vilo.site`, add wildcard `*.vilo.site` DNS + Vercel project domain (the on-switch + DNS are
> external; code is ready and inert until then). Shell `<html lang>` is `en` for tenants (site
> language still drives content via business default_language) — refine later if wanted.
> **W6 (create-site flow + builder shell, plan §8.6) DONE** (commit `8161446`): replaced the W2
> ComingSoon placeholder. `/dashboard/website` landing (dark hero + per-business create/manage;
> single business w/ site → editor). `createWebsiteAction` (subdomain reserved-check via shared
> `RESERVED_SUBDOMAINS`, one-site-per-business + global subdomain uniqueness, seeds starter Home+About
> pages + syncs properties/rooms as visible channel membership). `lib/website/subdomain.ts`+tests
> (`deriveSubdomain`/`validateSubdomain`→error codes). `[websiteId]` editor shell: `layout` (name +
> address + Preview `?site=&preview=1` + disabled Publish + tab bar Overview-live / rest "coming soon")
> + Overview (checklist + counts) + `loadWebsiteEditorData` (owner-scoped). New `website` i18n
> namespace (52 keys); help migration `20260617000600`. build+lint+type-check green; vitest 54/54.
> **STILL DEFERRED:** the business/website switcher (kept deferred — the per-business create/manage
> cards already handle multi-business; revisit if the editing flow needs a global active-business).
> **W7 (Brand & Theme tabs, plan §8.7) DONE** (commit `58f1831`): `[websiteId]/brand` +
> `[websiteId]/theme` routes wired live in `WebsiteTabs` (Overview/Brand/Theme live; rest "coming
> soon"). **Brand**: logo upload browser→Storage into public `website-assets` (signed-URL pattern:

> + name + tagline → `host_websites.brand` jsonb; `removeWebsiteLogoAction` clears path + deletes
> object. **Theme**: 5 preset swatches + accent/font/radius overrides (empty=inherit preset) + a live
> `--site-*` preview via `buildSiteVars` → `host_websites.theme` jsonb. `saveBrandAction`/
> `saveThemeAction` (+ `patchSiteJson` merge), owner-scoped `assertWebsiteOwnership` + pre-MVP
> `assertWebsiteFeature` short-circuit (§3.4); `brandSchema`/`themeSchema`. New shared
> `lib/website/assets.ts` (`websiteAssetUrl`) — SSOT path→public-URL, adopted by `loadSitePage`
> (logo now resolves) + `SitePageView.siteAsset`. **NO DB schema change** (brand/theme cols + bucket

> type-check green; `scripts/verify-website-brand-theme.mjs` 🎉.
> **W8 (Home + About section builder, plan §8.8) DONE** (commit pending): the flagship CMS editor.
> **Pages** tab now live → `[websiteId]/pages` (list: Home/About + section counts) → `pages/[pageId]`
> two-pane builder. LEFT: accordion of sections — add (typed menu), reorder (up/down buttons, NO
> `@dnd-kit`), show/hide, delete, click-to-edit. RIGHT: **inline live preview** through the SAME
> `components/site/*` renderer the public site uses (preview === public) + desktop/phone width toggle.
> `SectionEditor` = per-type RHF-free forms over the shared `sectionSchema` union (free-form edit
> text/images; auto-populate sections edit config only + "pulls live data" note). Reusable field
> primitives in `pages/[pageId]/_components/fields.tsx`. Section images (hero bg, host photo) upload
> browser→Storage via `createWebsiteAssetUploadUrl` (path saved into props on Save).
> `saveDraftSectionsAction` (owner-checked, validates via `sectionsSchema`, writes
> `website_pages.draft_sections`); `newSection()` defaults; `loadPageBuilder` + `loadPagesList`.
> **KEY REFACTOR:** `lib/site/loadSitePage.ts` now exports **`assembleSiteDataByType`** (data keyed
> by TYPE = SSOT); `assembleSectionData` fans it out by id; the builder preview reuses it via
> `loadSiteContext(subdomain,{preview})` so auto sections show REAL data. **NO DB schema change.**
> **DEVIATION (noted):** local React state in the one builder island instead of the plan's Zustand

> `20260617000800` pushed; +~95 `website` i18n keys (en). build+lint+type-check green.
> **W9 (Rooms tab, plan §8.9) DONE** (commit pending): Rooms tab now live in `WebsiteTabs` →
> `[websiteId]/rooms`. `loadRoomsEditor` (owner-scoped; properties → active `property_rooms` ⟕

> build+lint+type-check green; `scripts/verify-website-rooms.mjs` 🎉.
> **W10 (Publish workflow, plan §8.10) DONE** (commit pending): the editor header `PublishBar`
> island replaces the disabled button. `publishWebsiteAction` copies every page's `draft_sections`
> → `published_sections` and freezes the public-render config (brand/theme/nav + visible property
> ids + room overrides) into `host_websites.published_snapshot` + `status='published'` +

_(Previous focus below — hardening features for MVP — remains valid context.)_

## ✅ Done this session (2026-06-16) — Vilo product payments: reporting + invoices + thank-you + Meta Pixel + test mode
- Fixed: a Vilo product/subscription purchase paid with Paystack test keys
  "stopped" after payment and never showed in admin payments/ledger/reporting.
  Root cause: product orders settled only via the webhook. Now they settle on
  return (`confirmProductOrderByReference`), with the webhook as backstop.
- Post-payment **thank-you one-pager** + **auto-issued Vilo invoices**
  (`vilo_invoices`, minted by a `platform_ledger` trigger; public page + PDF;
  admin **Vilo business details** form). User **Settings → Transaction history**
  lists purchases with invoice downloads.
- **Admin-managed Meta Pixel** (Platform settings) + shared `firePurchase`
  (fbq Purchase with dynamic value + `eventID`; CAPI plumbed, not wired).
- **Test/Live tagging** (`environment`) + admin Payments Live/Test/All filter;
  live KPIs exclude test. Plan: `~/.claude/plans/when-a-user-pays-snuggly-bonbon.md`.
- **TODO before launch:** set the Paystack **test** webhook URL in the dashboard
  (backstop in test mode); fill Vilo business details for the invoice issuer;
  wire the Meta Conversions API server post; full i18n pass on the new strings.

## (Earlier) ✅ Affiliate programme (Phases 1–8)
- Full enterprise affiliate programme for Vilo products, open to any user
  (anchored on `user_profiles.id`, not host). Mounted at `/portal/affiliates`.
- 30-day cookie tracking + permanent binding; commission accrual/clearing/
  clawback engine (RPCs + crons); affiliate Overview/Products/Marketing/Payouts;
  payout requests with per-method fee; admin management + settings + the
  user-record Referrals tab. Migrations `…010`–`…018`; `verify-affiliate-ledger.mjs`
  16/16. Plan: `~/.claude/plans/flickering-tinkering-ripple.md`.
- **TODO before launch:** redeploy `paystack-webhook` (live accrual); add Supabase
  env vars to Vercel **Preview** scope (preview builds fail prerendering `/login`
  without them); platform-wide i18n pass covering portal/admin/affiliate strings;
  setup-fee commission when billing charges it as a separable amount.

## (Earlier) Harden each feature to 100% for MVP — Reviews feature, end-to-end.

## ✅ Done this session (2026-06-13) — Guest Reputation (hosts rate guests, cross-host)
- Built `host_review_guest.md` end-to-end: `guest_ratings` table (cross-host
  read RLS, own-row write, one living review per host/guest), `hostCanRateGuest`
  eligibility (completed/no-show), `upsert/deleteGuestRatingAction`, a new
  **Reputation** tab on the Guest Record (aggregate + your review + other hosts),
  and a `FormModal` rate-a-guest flow. Extracted shared `CategoryStars`.
- Migrations `20260613000020_create_guest_ratings.sql` +
  `20260613000021_help_guest_ratings.sql` pushed; types regenerated. `pnpm
  build` + `pnpm lint` green.
## ✅ Done this session (2026-06-13) — Ledger ↔ multi-business (Phases 1–2)
- Plan `LEDGER_MULTIBUSINESS_PLAN.md`. Confirmed finance **documents already**
  render the listing's business (no work). **Txn now business-aware** (derived
  via booking→listing→business_id; `fetchHostTransactions` businessId filter that
  scopes rows + running balance). **Business selector on the Ledger** + on the
  **Guest Record Finances tab** (server-side `?business=`; headline balance stays
  all-businesses). Also fixed the portal `in_app_notifications` user-scope.
- **Remaining (Phase 3, next chunk):** `business_id` on `guest_credit_ledger`
  (per-business store credit) + populate it on credit write-paths; headline still
  nets all. Then verify (2-business + shared guest) + help + ship.
- **Still parked:** guest-portal build plan (portal is ~95% built; only QA tracker exists).

## ✅ Done this session (2026-06-10) — Calendar: select a range on the grid + inline book
- **Industry-standard range selection on the month grid.** Tap check-in → later
  check-out; nights highlight, a **Selected range** card shows (listing picker,
  est. total, live booked/blocked conflict check). Actions: **Block** the nights
  (`setManualBlocksAction`) or **Create booking**.
- **Inline quick-book modal** (no page change) — compact `FormModal` over the
  calendar, dates locked, guest + price + payment; posts to the existing
  `createManualBookingAction` (SSOT, not forked). **Open the full editor**
  deep-links the wizard with listing + both dates for rooms/add-ons.
- Also fixed the single-day Availability panel from a UI re-review (booked rows
  open the booking; real status label; past dates read-only).
- Help: `20260610180007_help_calendar_inline_booking.sql` (re-upsert
  `managing-your-calendar`). `tsc` + `eslint` green on changed files. Commits
  `d22f8eb`, `5673295`.

## ✅ Done this session (2026-06-10) — Calendar: manage availability + book from it
- **Wired the calendar's existing-but-unused block actions into the UI.** New
  right-rail **Availability** panel (per listing for the selected day:
  Open/Booked/Blocked) with one-tap **Block**, **Open up** (unblock) and **Book**
  (deep-links the new-booking wizard with listing + check-in prefilled).
- **Block dates** top-bar button → canonical `FormModal` to block/open a whole
  range listing-wide (`setManualBlocksAction`); booked + quote-held nights left
  untouched. Single-day toggle uses `toggleBlockedDateAction`.
- **New-booking prefill** — `/dashboard/bookings/new` honours `?listing=&checkIn=&checkOut=`
  (validated server-side); `ManualBookingForm` seeds listing/dates/picker month.
- Help: `20260610170000_help_calendar_manage.sql` (`managing-your-calendar`).
  `tsc` + `lint` green. Commits `73ae1f9`, `f95a48f`.

## ✅ Done this session (2026-06-10) — Inbox: one chat design (host = guest)
- **Single source of truth for the inbox.** Extracted shared components in
  `components/inbox/` (`ConversationList`/`ConversationRow`, `ChatMessageWall`,
  `ChatComposer`, `ChatThreadHeader`, `InboxAvatar`) used by BOTH the host inbox
  and the guest portal.
- **Host inbox reworked to the guest's two-pane WhatsApp layout.** Removed the
  folder rail, deal **pipeline**, tabs, pagination, assignee, follow-up/snooze and
  internal notes. Kept: quick-reply templates, a slim Booking/Details slide-out,
  archive/un-archive, pin. Deep links (`?c=`, `?f=enquiries`) + full-bleed intact.
- Deleted `PipelineControl.tsx`/`ConversationNotes.tsx` + 4 dead actions. DB
  `pipeline_stage` column + guest auto-advance left in place (harmless).
- Help: `20260610160000_help_inbox_redesign.sql` (new `using-your-inbox`; corrected
  `enquiry-pipeline-inbox`) — **pushed to remote**. `tsc` + `lint` green.

## ✅ Done this session (2026-06-10) — Party guests → guest records + relationships
- **Party members become guest records.** Each named person on a booking's
  `additional_guests` is materialised into `host_contacts` (deduped by email) so
  the host can open/message/tag them individually — they show in the Guests
  directory + have a working record automatically (`_host_guest_rows` UNIONs
  `host_contacts`).
- **`guest_relationships`** table + RLS links each party member ↔ the lead booker
  (one row per direction, tagged with the booking). New **Relationships** tab on
  the guest record; **Guests** tab on the booking record (replaces "Guest")
  showing lead + party with per-member record links + an **Add guest** action.
- **Single-source materialiser** — `_materialize_booking_party()` called by an
  `AFTER UPDATE OF status` confirm trigger AND the ownership-checked
  `materialize_booking_party()` RPC (lazy fallback on the booking record +
  Add-guest). Checkout party manifest now requires name + email; thank-you page
  lists the party. Migrations `20260610150000`, `20260610150001` (help).

## ✅ Done earlier (2026-06-10) — Reviews to MVP
- **Photos on reviews** — public `review-photos` bucket + `review_photos` table;
  token-gated signed upload from the (account-less) submit form; one reusable
  `ReviewPhotoGrid` (lightbox) on listing / dashboard / admin / portal / confirm.
- **Delayed request** — checkout enqueues `review_request_queue(send_at=+5min)`;
  `/api/review-request-worker` + `drain-review-requests` cron drain it via one
  SSOT `lib/reviews/request.ts → sendReviewRequest()` (email + in-app + thread
  card). Old daily queuer → paid-aware 24h backstop.
- **Fixed broken plumbing** — emailed review link had no token (resolver now
  signs it); added the missing in-app builder; fixed tokenless portal CTA.
- **Publish immediately** (was 48h); `protect_review_content()` makes reviews
  immutable (hosts may only respond); host **Review link** card on bookings.
- **Eligibility** — only completed **+ paid** stays (refunded-after-stay still
  counts). Help articles `how-reviews-work` (host) + `leaving-a-review` (guest).
- **Ops TODO (founder, one-time):** Vault `review_request_worker_url`; confirm
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`. Probe: `scripts/verify-reviews.mjs` (green).

<details><summary>Previous focus — Finances are the spine</summary>

## ✅ Done (2026-06-08)
- **Reporting wired to the ledger** — new **Cash position** panel on Analytics
  (Collected/Outstanding/Refunded/Net cash + lifetime collection bar) sourced
  from `fetchHostTransactions`, so Reports, Ledger and Finances agree. Added
  canonical `txnFlows` (SSOT for collected/refunded/credits/charged); `txnStats`
  builds on it. Booked-value (accrual) vs cash explainer added; refund-rate
  labels disambiguated. Help article `reports-cash-position` (live). All 12
  analytics RPCs probed green against the real schema.
- **Booking-flow follow-ups** — live per-room availability + whole-place toggle
  (`b063d76`).
- **Host-Paystack spine fix** — guest card payments now charge the **host's own**
  connected Paystack (not the platform key); success-page verify uses the host
  key. `getHostPaystack` is the SSOT (`8a83d31`).
- **Pay-now link** — `bookings.pay_token` + public **`/pay/[token]`** page (card
  on host Paystack or EFT) + host **Payment link** card (Copy / WhatsApp /
  Email) on the Payments tab. Shared `startBookingPayment` core
  (`d6cffe3`, `3cd1134`). Help article `send-a-payment-link` applied.
- **Guardrails added** — AGENT_RULES **§4.7** (wire into the ledger, never fork
  the maths) + **§4.8** (booking card → host gateway). See
  `[[feedback_ledger_single_source_of_truth]]`.

</details>

## ▶ Next
1. **Test bookings end-to-end** with the host's connected Paystack test account
   (guest checkout card path + the `/pay/[token]` link). Founder-driven.
2. **Pay-link in the guest message thread** — deferred fast-follow (needs
   conversation lookup/creation; Copy/WhatsApp/Email cover resend today).
3. ✅ **Single-source-of-truth consolidation pass** (founder request) — DONE for
   the payments/finance audit: one `round2` (lib/format), one `INBOUND_KINDS` +
   `sumPaidFromRows`, success page via `confirmHostCardPaymentByReference`, one
   `requireHost()` adopted across ~14 action files, `getHostPaystack` in the
   banking link action, one `nightsBetween`. _Deliberately left:_ per-page
   `fmtDate` formatters (intentionally divergent — not forced).

<details><summary>Previous task — Booking Redesign — COMPLETE</summary>

**Plan:** see **`BOOKING_REDESIGN_PLAN.md`** (repo root) — full, buildable, phased.
**Designs:** `C:\Users\Wollie\Downloads\Listing 3.0.html` (listing) +
`C:\Users\Wollie\Downloads\Booking Flow.html` (checkout).

## Start here
1. Read `BOOKING_REDESIGN_PLAN.md` end-to-end.
2. Build phase-by-phase (§4), committing + pushing after each; `pnpm build` +
   `pnpm lint` green every time; tick the §5 Progress box.
3. Resolve the §3 flags (add-on units, in-flow availability, listing cleanup)
   in-phase — flag the founder before any schema change.

> Goal: listing page is **display-only** with **two CTAs** — **Reserve**
> (→ self-contained 3-step Rooms→Details→Payment flow) and **Request a quote**
> (→ existing modal). Guests cannot select rooms or book on the listing itself.

</details>

<details><summary>Previous task — Guest Record (CRM) — COMPLETE</summary>

**Plan:** `GUEST_RECORD_PLAN.md` · **Design:** `Guest Record.html`. Feature
complete (see Progress below).
</details>

## One-line summary
Add a **Guests** sidebar item (after Bookings); a Guests list (`/dashboard/guests`); a CRM **Guest
Record** page (`/dashboard/guests/[gkey]`) — identity + verifications, lifetime stat band, tabs
Overview/Bookings/Messages/Payments/Notes; two-way linked with Booking Details. New tables:
`guest_notes`, `guest_tags`, + `user_profiles` verification columns. Guests are keyed by a unified
`gkey` (user_profiles.id, or `e_<base64url(email)>` for email-only manual-booking contacts).

> **ARCHITECTURE CHANGE (2026-06-06):** founder chose to **reuse & extend** the
> existing `host_contacts` (tags/notes/blocked, deduped by email) + `message_templates`
> (full CRUD in `inbox/actions.ts`, `{{guest_name}}` tokens) instead of the plan's
> parallel `guest_contacts`/`guest_tags`/`guest_flags`/new-templates tables. Only
> `guest_notes` is genuinely new. `gkey` is a URL/resolution scheme, not a stored
> column. Inbox **Contacts tab + page removed** (Guests supersedes it). Keep it lean.

## Progress (Guest CRM build)
- ✅ **Phase 1** schema — extended host_contacts (+country/email_consent/blocked_*),
  new `guest_notes`, user_profiles verify cols, seeded message_templates. (commit 59856e8)
- ✅ Inbox Contacts tab + page removed. (632aa71)
- ✅ **Phase 2** RPCs — `_host_guest_rows`, `fetch_host_guests`(+`_summary`),
  `fetch_guest_record`; demo-host probe green. (e627e55)
- ✅ **Phase 3** sidebar entry + badge + `/dashboard/guests` list (KPI strip, segments,
  search, density, sort, pagination, rows). (06f0f76)
- ✅ **Phase 4** Add guest modal + filters + selection/bulk Tag·Export + CSV/vCard
  actions on host_contacts (lazy upsert). (d2d9092)
- ✅ **Phase 5** Guest Record shell — identity + stat band + Overview/Bookings/Payments + prev/next. (5a332e0)
- ✅ **Phase 6** Messages + Notes tabs (+ template picker) + Templates manager. (6aebc9b)
- ✅ **Phase 7** Booking↔record link + record More-menu (tag/block/export/new-booking). (cc8c089)
- ✅ **Phase 8** Help article (`guests-crm`) + CHANGELOG.
- ✅ **Phase 9** Bulk mailer — guest_marketing + guest_broadcasts + RPCs;
  lib/guests/broadcast.ts (Resend, server-side); sendBroadcastAction (monthly cap);
  BroadcastModal ("Email guests"); public /unsubscribe/[token]; per-guest opt-out.
  **Build-only — not deployed/sent.** Uses existing RESEND_API_KEY +
  EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS + NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL (no new env, no edge fn — sends from a
  Server Action like the rest of the app). Founder to do the first live-send test.
- ✅ **Extra (founder request):** record **Reviews** + **Finances** (invoices/
  quotes/refunds/credit-notes) tabs; POPIA marketing-consent control (locked,
  opt-out only); per-host isolation confirmed (already enforced by RLS).

**Feature complete.** Remaining before real email use: set a verified Resend
sender domain and run a live-send smoke test; consider AAL2/MFA restore (separate).

Probes: `scripts/verify-guest-crm-p1.mjs`, `verify-guest-crm-p2.mjs` (run from apps/web).

---

## ✅ Previously completed (this session group)
- **Analytics variable-mismatch fix** — 12 RPCs realigned to the real schema; missing tables created.
- **Unified shell theme** — host dashboard, guest portal, super admin all on `ClassicShellFrame` +
  `AppHeader` + `GmailNav` (collapsible 76px rail); founder tweaks (no compose, no plan card, no header
  New-booking, thin scrollbar).
- **New Booking 5-step wizard** — `ManualBookingForm` re-laid into Property → Dates & guests → Guest →
  Price & extras → Payment, real logic preserved.
